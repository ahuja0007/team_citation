V  The ability to now make measurements of Be and B as well as put constraints\u000aon \u005clisix\u005c abundances in metal-poor stars has led to a detailed reexamination\u000aof Big Bang Nucleosynthesis in the $A\u005cgroughly6$ regime. The nuclear reaction\u000anetwork has been significantly expanded with many new rates added. It is\u000ademonstrated that although a number of $A>7$ reaction rates are poorly\u000adetermined, even with extreme values chosen, the standard homogeneous model is\u000aunable to produce significant yields (Be/H and B/H $<10^{-17}$ when $A\u005cle7$\u000aabundances fit) above $A=7$ and the \u005cliseven/\u005clisix\u005c ratio always exceeds 500.\u000aWe also preliminarily explore inhomogeneous models, such as those inspired by a\u000afirst order quark-hadron phase transition, where regions with high\u000aneutron/proton ratios can allow some leakage up to $A>7$. However models that\u000afit the $A\u005cle7$ abundances still seem to have difficulty in obtaining\u000asignificant $A>7$ yields.\u000a

We use an\u000aanalytic model for the $\u005cDelta T/T$ power spectrum that is based on our\u000aprevious numerical simulations to show that the COBE results imply a value for\u000athe string mass per unit length, $\u005cmu$ under the assumption that cosmic strings\u000aare the source of the measured anisotropy. We find $G\u005cmu = 1.5\u005cpm 0.5 \u005ctimes\u000a10^{-6}$ which is consistent with the value of $\u005cmu$ thought to be required for\u000acosmic strings to seed galaxy formation.\u000a

Our calculations\u000agive only upper limits for the gamma ray flux, since the source of the photons,\u000ajets from particle production at cusps, may be weakened by back reaction\u000aeffects. For the usual cosmic distribution of strings, the predicted bursts\u000afrom strings with the value of mass per unit length associated with galaxy\u000aformation or light strings may just be detectable.

V  Point particles fall freely along geodesics; strings do not. In string theory\u000aall probes of spacetime structure, including photons, are extended objects and\u000atherefore always subject to tidal forces. We illustrate how string theory\u000amodifies the behavior of light in weak gravitational fields and limits the\u000aapplicability of the principle of equivalence. This gives in principle a window\u000aon the short-distance structure of geometry in quantum gravity where one can\u000asee in a model-independent way how some of its predictions differ from those of\u000aclassical gravity. We compare this with the lessons of high-energy string\u000ascattering.\u000a

V  It is proposed that gamma-ray bursts are created in the mergers of double\u000aneutron star binaries and black hole neutron star binaries at cosmological\u000adistances. Bursts with complex profiles and relatively long durations are the\u000aresult of magnetic flares generated by the Parker instability in a post-merger\u000adifferentially-rotating disk. Some bursts may also be produced through\u000aneutrino-antineutrino annihilation into electrons and positrons. In both cases,\u000aan optically thick fireball of size $\u005csles\u005c 100$ km is initially created, which\u000aexpands ultrarelativistically to large radii before radiating. Several previous\u000aobjections to the cosmological merger model are eliminated. It is predicted\u000athat $\u005cgamma$-ray bursts will be accompanied by a burst of gravitational\u000aradiation from the spiraling-in binary which could be detected by LIGO.\u000a

If we were able to measure both the Hubble constant and the energy\u000adensity we could determine whether the universe is open or closed.\u000aUnfortunately, while some agreement exists on the value of the Hubble constant,\u000athe question of the energy density seems quite intractable.

V  Constraints on the core temperature (T_c) of the Sun and on neutrino-\u000aoscillation parameters are obtained from the existing solar neutrino data,\u000aincluding the recent GALLEX and Kamiokande III results. (1) A purely\u000aastrophysical solution to the solar neutrino problem is strongly disfavored by\u000athe data: the best fit in a cooler Sun model requires an 8% reduction in T_c,\u000abut the chi-sqaured test rejects this hypothesis at 99.99% C.L., suggesting new\u000aneutrino physics. (2) Assuming the Standard Solar Model (SSM) and MSW\u000aoscillations, the MSW parameters are constrained to two small regions: one in\u000athe non-adiabatic region and the other in the large-mixing region. The\u000anon-adiabatic solution gives a considerably better fit. For nu_e oscillations\u000ainto sterile neutrinos, the allowed region (90%) is constrained to non-\u000aadiabatic oscillations. As long as the SSM is assumed, the neutrino mixing\u000aangles are at least four times larger, or considerably smaller, than the\u000acorresponding quark mixing angles. (3) Allowing both MSW oscillations and a\u000anon-standard core temperature, a) the experiments determine the core\u000atemperature at the 5% level, yielding a value consistent with the SSM\u000aprediction. b) When T_c is used as a free parameter, the allowed MSW region is\u000abroadened: a cooler Sun (T_c=0.95) allows mass and mixing implied by the SUSY\u000aSO(10) GUT, while a warmer Sun (T_c=1.05) allows parameter space suggested by\u000aintermediate-scale SO(10) GUTs. Superstring-inspired models are consistent with\u000aall solutions. (4) From the narrowed parameter space, we predict the neutrino\u000aspectral shape which should be observed in SNO. Throughout the calculation we\u000ause the latest Bahcall-Pinsonneault SSM, and include nuclear and astrophysical\u000auncertainties in a simplified, but physically transparent way.\u000a

V  There exists a class of cosmic strings that turn matter into antimatter\u000a(Alice strings). In a GUT where the unbroken gauge group contains charge\u000aconjugation ($C$), such strings form when a phase transition renders $C$ a\u000adiscrete symmetry. They become boundaries of domain walls at a later,\u000a$C$-breaking transition. These `Alice walls' are cosmologically harmless, but\u000acan play an important role in baryogenesis. We present a three-generation toy\u000amodel with scalar baryons, where a quasi-static Alice wall (or a gas of such\u000awalls) temporarily gives rise to net baryogenesis of uniform sign everywhere in\u000aspace. This becomes a permanent baryon excess if the wall shrinks away early\u000aenough.\u000a  We comment on the possible relevance of a similar mechanism to baryogenesis\u000ain a realistic $\u005csoten$ unification model, where\u000a  Alice walls would form at the scale of left-right symmetry breaking.\u000a

V  Dust is observed to form in nova ejecta. The grain temperature is determined\u000aby the diluted nova radiation field rather than the gas kinetic temperature,\u000amaking classical nucleation theory inapplicable. We used kinetic equations to\u000acalculate the growth of carbon nuclei in these ejecta. For expected values of\u000athe parameters too many clusters grew, despite the small sticking probability\u000aof atoms to small clusters, and the clusters only reached radii of about\u000a100\u005cAA\u005c when the carbon vapor was depleted. We then included the effects of\u000acluster photodissociation by ultraviolet radiation from the nova. This\u000asuppresses nucleation, but too well, and no grains form at all. Finally we\u000asuggest that a few growing carbon nuclei may be protected from\u000aphotodissociation by a sacrificial surface layer of hydrogen.\u000a

V  We present an in depth discussion of the production of gravitational waves\u000afrom an inflationary phase that could have occurred in the early universe,\u000agiving derivations for the resulting spectrum and energy density. We also\u000aconsider the large-scale anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background\u000aradiation coming from these waves. Assuming that the observed quadrupole\u000aanisotropy comes mostly from gravitational waves (consistent with the\u000apredictions of a flat spectrum of scalar density perturbations and the measured\u000adipole anisotropy) we describe in detail how to derive a value for the scale of\u000ainflation of $(1.5-5)\u005ctimes 10^{16}$GeV, which is at a particularly interesting\u000ascale for particle physics. This upper limit corresponds to a 95\u005c% confidence\u000alevel upper limit on the scale of inflation assuming only that the quadrupole\u000aanisotropy from gravitational waves is not cancelled by another source. Direct\u000adetection of gravitational waves produced by inflation near this scale will\u000ahave to wait for the next generation of detectors.\u000a

V  The four observables associated with gravitational lensing of distant quasars\u000aby intervening galaxies: image splittings, relative amplifications, time\u000adelays, and optical depths, provide separate measures of the strength of the\u000agravitational constant $G$ at cosmological distances. These allow one, in\u000aprinciple, to factor out unknown lensing parameters to directly to probe the\u000avariation of $G$ over cosmological time. We estimate constraints on $\u005cdot{G}$\u000awhich may be derivable by this method both now and in the future. The limits\u000aone may obtain can compete or exceed other direct limits on $\u005cdot{G}$ today,\u000abut unfortunately extracting this information, is not independent of the effort\u000ato fix other cosmological parameters such as $H_0$ and $\u005cOmega_0$ from lensing\u000aobservations.\u000a

V  The BATSE experiment on GRO has demonstrated the isotropic arrival directions\u000aand flat $\u005clog N$ {\u005cit vs.} $\u005clog S$ of cosmic gamma-ray bursts. These data are\u000abest explained if the burst sources are distributed throughout an extended\u000aspherical Galactic halo, as previously suggested by Jennings. The halo's radius\u000ais at least 40 Kpc, and probably is more than 100 Kpc. I consider possible\u000aorigins of this halo, including primordial formation and neutron stars\u000arecoiling from their birthplaces in the Galactic disc. A simple geometrical\u000amodel leads to a predicted relation between the dipole and quadrupole\u000aanisotropy. I suggest that neutron stars born with low recoil become\u000amillisecond pulsars, while those born with high recoil become the sources of\u000agamma-ray bursts; these populations are nearly disjoint. Quiescent counterparts\u000aof gamma-ray bursts are predicted to be undetectably faint.\u000a

V  The appearance of two geometries in one and the same gravitational theory is\u000afamiliar. Usually, as in the Brans-Dicke theory or in string theory, these are\u000aconformally related Riemannian geometries. Is this the most general relation\u000abetween the two geometries allowed by physics ? We study this question by\u000asupposing that the physical geometry on which matter dynamics take place could\u000abe Finslerian rather than just Riemannian. An appeal to the weak equivalence\u000aprinciple and causality then leads us the conclusion that the Finsler geometry\u000ahas to reduce to a Riemann geometry whose metric - the physical metric - is\u000arelated to the gravitational metric by a generalization of the conformal\u000atransformation.\u000a

V  We use the Expanding Photosphere Method to determine distances to 10 type II\u000asupernovae. The effects of asymmetries, extinction, and flux dilution are\u000aexplored. Using empirical evidence and time-independent, spherical models which\u000atreat H and He in non-LTE, we show that blackbody corrections caused by flux\u000adilution are small for type II supernovae in the infrared, and in the optical\u000awhen their color temperatures are less than 6000~K. The extinction to a type\u000aII-P supernova can be estimated from its light curve: the uncertainty\u000aintroduced into a distance measurement due to extinction is usually less than\u000a10\u005c%. Correcting for extinction and flux dilution we derive distances to 10\u000asupernovae: SN 1968L, SN 1969L, SN 1970G, SN 1973R, SN 1979C, SN 1980K, SN\u000a1987A, SN 1988A, SN 1990E, and SN 1990ae. The distance measurements span a wide\u000arange, 50 kpc to 120 Mpc, which is unique among the methods for establishing\u000athe extragalactic distance scale. The distances measured to SN 1970G in M101\u000aand SN 1987A in the LMC are in good agreement with distances determined from\u000aCepheid variable stars. Our distance to the Virgo Cluster, 22 +- 3 Mpc, is\u000alarger than recent distances estimates made using surface brightness\u000afluctuations, planetary nebula luminosity functions, and the Tully-Fisher\u000amethod. Using the distances determined from these type II supernovae we derive\u000aa value of $H_0 = 60 \u005cpm 10$ km sec$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$. This value is subject to\u000aerrors caused by local deviations in the Hubble flow, but will soon be improved\u000aby applying the Expanding Photosphere Method to several distant type II\u000asupernovae.\u000a

V  The lensing effect of curved space, which can cause the angular diameter of a\u000afixed reference length seen on the sky to reach a minimum and then increase\u000awith redshift, depends sensitively on the value of the cosmological constant,\u000a$\u005cLambda$, in a flat universe. The redshift of an observed minimum and the\u000aasymptotic slope can in principle provide strong constraints on $\u005cLambda$. The\u000asensitivity to a non-zero cosmological constant in a flat universe is compared\u000ato the sensitivity to $q_0$ in an open universe without a cosmological\u000aconstant, and to inherent ambiguities due to uncertainties in distance measures\u000aand the possible effects of evolution. If evolutionary uncertainties can be\u000aovercome, the reported observations of the angular diameter of compact radio\u000ajets as a function of redshift, which appear to exhibit such a minimum, could\u000aprovide the strongest available limit on the cosmological constant in a flat\u000auniverse, and on $\u005cOmega$ in an open universe.\u000a

V  Bubbles in a first-order electroweak phase transition are nucleated with\u000aradii $R_0$ and expand with velocity $v$. If $v$ is subsonic, a bubble becomes\u000aunstable to non-spherical perturbations when its radius is roughly $10^4\u005c,\u000aR_0$. These perturbations accelerate the transition, and the effective velocity\u000aof bubble growth rapidly becomes supersonic. The transition should subsequently\u000aproceed spherically via detonation. If for some reason the onset of detonation\u000ais postponed, the surface area of the bubbles may be enhanced by $10^5$. We\u000adiscuss consequences for electroweak baryogenesis.\u000a

V  We have calculated gamma-ray radiative transport in regions of high energy\u000adensity, such as gamma-ray burst source regions, using a discrete ordinate,\u000adiscrete energy group method. The calculations include two-photon pair\u000aproduction and annihilation, as well as three-photon pair annihilation. The\u000aradiation field itself acts as an absorbing medium, and the optical depth\u000adepends on its intensity, so the problem is intrinsically nonlinear. Spherical\u000adivergence produces effective collimation of the flux. At high optical depth\u000athe high energy ($E > 1$ MeV) portion of the emergent spectrum assumes a nearly\u000auniversal form. An approximate limit is derived for the high energy flux from a\u000agamma-ray burst source region of given size, and the implications of this limit\u000afor the distance to the March 5, 1979 event are briefly discussed. We discuss\u000amore generally the problem of very luminous bursts, and implications of\u000aGalactic halo distances for flare models.\u000a

V  Naked singularities appear naturally in dynamically evolving solutions of\u000aEinstein equations involving gravitational collapse of radiation, dust and\u000aperfect fluids, provided the rate of accretion is less than a critical value.\u000aWe propose that the gamma-ray bursters (GRBs) are examples of these naked\u000asingularity solutions. For illustration, we show that according to solutions\u000ainvolving spherically symmetric collapse of pure radiation field, the energy\u000a$E_\u005cgamma$ and the observed duration $\u005cDelta t_o$ of a GRB should satisfy,\u000a$\u005cfrac{E_\u005cgamma}{\u005cDelta t_o} \u005cleq 4.5 \u005ctimes 10^{58} \u005c f_\u005cgamma $ erg\u000asec$^{-1}$, $f_\u005cgamma$ being the fraction ($10^{-2}$ to $10^{-3}$) of energy\u000areleased as gamma rays. All the presently observed GRBs satisfy this condition;\u000athose satisfying the condition close to equality must necessarily be of\u000acosmological origin with the red-shift factor $z$ not exceeding $\u005csim 2-10$\u000adepending on exact observed flux.\u000a

V  We report on a calculation of large scale anisotropy in the cosmic microwave\u000abackground radiation in the global monopole and texture models for cosmic\u000astructure formation. We have evolved the six component linear gravitational\u000afield along with the monopole or texture scalar fields numerically in an\u000aexpanding universe and performed the Sachs-Wolfe integrals directly on the\u000acalculated gravitational fields. On scales $> 7^\u005ccirc$, we find a Gaussian\u000adistribution with an approximately scale invariant fluctuation spectrum. The\u000a$\u005cDelta T/T$ amplitude is a factor of 4-5 larger than the prediction of the\u000astandard CDM model with the same Hubble constant and density fluctuation\u000anormalization. The recently reported COBE-DMR results imply that global\u000amonopole and texture models require high bias factors or a large Hubble\u000aconstant in contrast to standard CDM which requires very low $H_0$ and bias\u000avalues. For $H_0 = 70 {\u005crm {km\u005cover sec} Mpc^{-1}}$, we find that normalizing\u000ato the COBE results implies $b_8 \u005csimeq 3.2\u005cpm 1.4$ (95\u005c% c.l.). If we restrict\u000aourselves to the range of bias factors thought to be reasonable before the\u000aannouncement of the COBE results, $1.5 \u005clsim b_8 \u005clsim 2.5$, then it is fair to\u000aconclude that global monopoles and textures are consistent with the COBE\u000aresults and are a {\u005cit better} fit than Standard CDM.\u000a

V  This article gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the formation of\u000atrapped surfaces in spherically symmetric initial data defined on a closed\u000amanifold. Such trapped surfaces surround a region in which there occurs an\u000aenhancement of matter over the average. The conditions are posed directly in\u000aterms of physical variables and show that what one needs is a relatively large\u000aamount of excess matter confined to a small volume. The expansion of the\u000auniverse and an outward flow of matter oppose the formation of trapped\u000asurfaces; an inward flow of matter helps. The model can be regarded as a\u000aFriedmann-Lema\u005c^\u005ci tre-Walker cosmology with localized spherical\u000ainhomogeneities. We show that the total excess mass cannot be too large.\u000a

V  The cold dark matter (CDM) model of structure formation, normalized on large\u000ascales, leads to excessive pairwise velocity dispersions on small scales. In an\u000aattempt to circumvent this problem, we study three scenarios (all with\u000a$\u005cOmega=1$) which have more large-scale power and less small-scale power than\u000athe CDM model: 1) an admixture of cold and hot dark matter; 2) cold dark matter\u000awith a non-scale-invariant, power-law primordial power spectrum; and 3) cold\u000adark matter with coupling of dark matter to a long-range vector field. Despite\u000athe {reduced} small-scale power, when such models are evolved in the nonlinear\u000aregime to large amplitude, the velocities on small scales are actually {\u005cit\u000aincreased} over CDM with the same value of $\u005csigma_8$. This `flip-over', in\u000adisagreement with the expectation from linear perturbation theory, arises from\u000athe nonlinear coupling of the extra power on large scales with shorter\u000awavelengths. However, due to the extra large-scale power, the recent COBE DMR\u000aresults indicate smaller amplitudes for these models, $\u005csigma_8 \u005csim 0.5 -\u000a0.7$, than for CDM (for which $\u005csigma_8 \u005csim 1.2$). Therefore, when normalized\u000ato COBE on large scales, such models do lead to reduced velocities on small\u000ascales and they produce fewer halos compared with CDM. Quantitatively it seems,\u000ahowever, that models that produce sufficiently low small-scale velocities fail\u000ato produce an adequate distribution of halos.\u000a

V  In QCD with two flavors of massless quarks, the chiral phase transition is\u000aplausibly in the same universality class as the classical four component\u000aHeisenberg antiferromagnet. Therefore, renormalization group techniques\u000adeveloped in the study of phase transitions can be applied to calculate the\u000acritical exponents which characterize the scaling behaviour of universal\u000aquantities near the critical point. This approach to the QCD phase transition\u000ahas implications both for lattice gauge theory and for heavy ion collisions.\u000aFuture lattice simulations with longer correlation lengths will be able to\u000ameasure the various exponents and the equation of state for the order parameter\u000aas a function of temperature and quark mass which we describe. In a heavy ion\u000acollision, the consequence of a long correlation length would be large\u000afluctuations in the number ratio of neutral to charged pions. Unfortunately, we\u000ashow that this phenomenon will not occur if the plasma stays close to\u000aequilibrium as it cools. If the transition is far out of equilibrium and can be\u000amodelled as a quench, it is possible that large volumes of the plasma with the\u000apion field correlated will develop, with dramatic phenomenological\u000aconsequences. }\u000a

V  A pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson, with a potential of the form $V(\u005cphi) =\u000a\u005cLambda^4[1 \u005cpm \u005ccos(\u005cphi/f)], naturally gives rise to inflation if $f \u005csim\u000aM_{Pl}$ and $\u005cLambda \u005csim M_{GUT}$. We show how this can arise in\u000atechnicolor-like and superstring models, and work out an explicit string\u000aexample in the context of multiple gaugino condensation models. We study the\u000acosmology of this model in detail, and find that sufficient reheating to ensure\u000athat baryogenesis can take place requires $f > 0.3 M_{Pl}$. The primordial\u000adensity fluctuation spectrum generated is a non-scale-invariant power law,\u000a$P(k) \u005cpropto k^{n_s}$, with $n_s \u005csimeq 1 - (M^2_{Pl}/8\u005cpi f^2)$, leading to\u000amore power on large length scales than the $n_s = 1$ Harrison-Zeldovich\u000aspectrum. The standard CDM model with $0 \u005cla n_s \u005cla 0.6-0.7$ could in\u000aprinciple explain the large-scale clustering observed in the APM and IRAS\u000agalaxy surveys as well as large-scale flows, but the COBE microwave anisotropy\u000aimplies such low amplitudes (or high bias factors, $b>2$) for these CDM models\u000athat galaxy formation occurs too late to be viable; combining COBE with\u000asufficiently early galaxy formation or the large-scale flows leads to $n_s\u000a>0.6$, or $f > 0.3 M_{Pl}$ as well. For extended and power law inflation\u000amodels, this constraint is even tighter, $n_s > 0.7$; combined with other\u000abounds on large bubbles in extended inflation, this leaves little room for most\u000aextended models.\u000a

V  Inflation creates both scalar (density) and tensor (gravity wave) metric\u000aperturbations. We find that the tensor mode contribution to the CMB anisotropy\u000aon large-angular scales can only exceed that of the scalar mode in models where\u000athe spectrum of perturbations deviates significantly from scale invariance\u000a(e.g., extended and power-law inflation models and extreme versions of chaotic\u000ainflation). If the tensor mode dominates at large-angular scales, then the\u000avalue of $\u005cDelta T/T$ predicted on $1^\u005ccirc$ is less than if the scalar mode\u000adominates, and, for cold dark matter models, $b>1$ can be made consistent with\u000athe COBE DMR results.\u000a

V  We introduce an approximation to calculate the gravitational radiation\u000aproduced by the collision of true-vacuum bubbles that is simple enough to allow\u000athe simulation of a phase transition by the collision of hundreds of bubbles.\u000aThis ``envelope approximation'' neglects the complicated ``overlap'' regions of\u000acolliding bubbles and follows only the evolution of the bubble walls. The\u000aapproximation accurately reproduces previous results for the gravitational\u000aradiation from the collision of two scalar-field vacuum bubbles. Using a bubble\u000anucleation rate given by $\u005cGamma = \u005cGamma_0 e^{\u005cbeta t}$, we simulate a phase\u000atransition by colliding 20 to 200 bubbles; the fraction of vacuum energy\u000areleased into gravity waves is $E_{\u005crm GW}/E_{\u005crm vac} = 0.06(H/\u005cbeta)^2$ and\u000athe peak of the spectrum occurs at $\u005comega_{\u005crm max}=1.6\u005cbeta$ ($H^2=8\u005cpi G\u005crho\u000a/3$ is the Hubble constant associated with the false-vacuum phase). The\u000aspectrum is very similar to that in the two-bubble case, except that the\u000aefficiency of gravity-wave generation is about five times higher, presumably\u000adue to the fact that a given bubble collides with many others. Finally, we\u000aconsider two further ``statistical'' approximations, where the gravitational\u000aradiation is computed as an incoherent sum over individual bubbles weighted by\u000athe distribution of bubble sizes. These approximations provide reasonable\u000aestimates of the gravitational-wave spectrum with far less computation.\u000a

As reviewed in this lecture, topological defect models of\u000astructure formation generically produce such a spectrum. We give a summary of\u000athe cosmic string and global texture models, focusing on distinct observational\u000asignatures in large-scale structure surveys and in the microwave background. It\u000ais shown that the amplitude of the CMB quadrupole detected by COBE is in good\u000aagreement with the predictions of the cosmic string model.\u000a

V  We consider the production of neutrinos in active galactic nuclei (AGN)\u000athrough hadronic cascades. The initial, high energy nucleons are accelerated in\u000aa source above the accretion disk around the central black hole. From the\u000asource, the particles diffuse back to the disk and initiate hadronic cascades.\u000aThe observable output from the cascade are electromagnetic radiation and\u000aneutrinos. We use the observed diffuse background X-ray luminosity, which\u000apresumably results {}from this process, to predict the diffuse neutrino flux\u000aclose to existing limits from the Frejus experiment. The resulting neutrino\u000aspectrum is $E^{-2}$ down to the $\u005cGeV$ region. We discuss modifications of\u000athis scenario which reduce the predicted neutrino flux.\u000a

In all the investigations of this problem it has\u000abeen assumed that the degree of supercooling of the quark-gluon plasma after\u000athe phase transition is large enough to produce a significant rate of\u000anucleation of hadrons. Using the latest results of finite temperature lattice\u000aQCD and the finite size scaling theory, we argue that the degree of\u000asupercooling is in fact extremely small and hence the nucleation rate is\u000anegligible.\u000a

V  We asses the contribution to the observed large scale anisotropy of the\u000acosmic microwave background radiation, arising from both gravity waves as well\u000aas adiabatic density perturbations, generated by a common inflationary\u000amechanism in the early Universe.\u000a  We find that for inflationary models predicting power law primordial spectra\u000a%$a(t) \u005cpropto t^p, p > 1$, $\u005cdk^2 \u005cpropto k^n$, the relative contribution to\u000athe quadrupole anisotropy from gravity waves and scalar density perturbations,\u000adepends crucially upon $n$. For $n < 0.87$, gravity waves perturb the CMBR by a\u000alarger amount than density perturbations, whereas for $n > 0.87$ the reverse is\u000atrue. %For nearly exponential inflation, on the other hand, the contribution to\u000athe %microwave anisotropy from scalar density perturbations always exceeds\u000a%that due to gravity waves. Normalising the amplitude of the density\u000aperturbation spectrum at large scales, using the observed value of the COBE\u000aquadrupole, we determine $(\u005cdelta M /M)_{16}$ -- the rms density contrast on\u000ascales $\u005csim 16 h_{50}^{-1}$ Mpc, for cosmological models with cold dark\u000amatter. We find that for $n < 0.75$, a large amount of biasing is required in\u000aorder to reconcile theory with observations.\u000a

This finding, based on {\u005cit ad hoc\u005c/} new\u000aobservations, is confirmed by a much larger set of literature data for\u000a$\u005csim1500$ galaxies. The {\u005cit `ordinary'\u005c/} family is biparametric: $L_T\u005cpropto\u000aI_e\u005c,R_e^2$; its members are fainter that $M_B\u005csimeq-19.3$ and smaller than\u000a$\u005cre\u005csimeq3$ kpc (whatever $M_B$ is). The {\u005cit 'bright'\u005c/} family is\u000auniparametric ($\u005cmu_e$ depends on $R_e$ alone) and hosts brightest cluster\u000amembers and QSO parent galaxies. We show that the segregation in the ($\u005clog\u000aR_e, \u005cmu_e$) plane has an important counterpart in the behavior of various\u000aphysical parameters, which is markedly different for galaxies smaller ({\u005cit\u000a`ordinary'\u005c/} family) and larger ({\u005cit 'bright'\u005c/} family) than $R_e=3$ kpc.\u000a

V  The spontaneous breaking of local Lorentz invariance in the early Universe,\u000aassociated with a first order phase transition at a critical time $t_c$,\u000agenerates a large increase in the speed of light and a superluminary\u000acommunication of information occurs, allowing all regions in the Universe to be\u000acausally connected. This solves the horizon problem, leads to a mechanism of\u000amonopole suppression in cosmology and can resolve the flatness problem. After\u000athe critical time $t_c$, local Lorentz (and diffeomorphism) invariance is\u000arestored and light travels at its presently measured speed. The kinematical and\u000adynamical aspects of the generation of quantum fluctuations in the\u000asuperluminary Universe are investigated. A scale invariant prediction for the\u000afluctuation density amplitude is obtained.\u000a

Our model is based on counting random\u000amultiple impulses inflicted on photon trajectories by the string network\u000abetween the time of recombination and today. We construct the temperature\u000aauto-correlation function and use it to obtain the effective power spectrum\u000aindex n, the rms-quadrupole-normalized amplitude $Q_{rms-PS}$ and the rms\u000atemperature variation smoothed on small angular scales.

V  Here I examine how to determine the sensitivity of the LIGO, VIRGO, and LAGOS\u000agravitational wave detectors to sources of gravitational radiation by\u000aconsidering the process by which data are analyzed in a noisy detector. By\u000aconstructing the probability that the detector output is consistent with the\u000apresence of a signal, I show how to (1) quantify the uncertainty that the\u000aoutput contains a signal and is not simply noise, and (2) construct the\u000aprobability distribution that the signal parameterization has a certain value.\u000a  From the distribution and its mode I determine volumes $V(P)$ in parameter\u000aspace such that actual signal parameters are in $V(P)$ with probability $P$. If\u000awe are {\u005cem designing} a detector, or determining the suitability of an\u000aexisting detector for observing a new source, then we don't have detector\u000aoutput to analyze but are interested in the ``most likely'' response of the\u000adetector to a signal. I exploit the techniques just described to determine the\u000a``most likely'' volumes $V(P)$ for detector output corresponding to the source.\u000aFinally, as an example, I apply these techniques to anticipate the sensitivity\u000aof the LIGO and LAGOS detectors to the gravitational radiation from a perturbed\u000aKerr black hole.\u000a

V  We apply Perlick's (1990a) rigorous formulation of the Fermat principle in\u000aarbitrary spacetimes to prove the correctness of the description of\u000agravitational lensing by gravitational waves, given in the literature using the\u000ascalar and vector formalisms. We obtain an expression for the time delay due to\u000asuch nonstationary lenses; the advantage over previous papers is that Perlick's\u000aformulation of the Fermat principle is very rigorous and more suitable for\u000apractical calculations in some cases. It is also shown that ordinary moving\u000agravitational lenses must be considered as a stationary case.\u000a

We\u000aperform a statistical (correlation and cluster) analysis of a sample of Abell\u000aand ACO galaxy clusters in the southern galactic hemisphere. We compare these\u000aresults with a symmetric sample at northern galactic latitude taken from\u000aPostman et al. (1992). For the northern sample, we substantially confirm the\u000aresults of Postman et al. We find that the two-point spatial correlation\u000afunction of northern and southern clusters is comparable, with mean correlation\u000alength 19.6 Mpc and slope -1.8 positive up to about 45 Mpc. Percolation\u000aproperties are remarkably similar in the northern and southern cluster samples.\u000aWe give also a catalog of superclusters. In the south galactic hemisphere the\u000amain feature is a very rich, extended supercluster in the Horologium region at\u000aa redshift 0.06, near to a large void.\u000a

V  We show that under certain astrophysical conditions a binary system\u000aconsisting of two compact objects can be stabilized against indefinite\u000ashrinking of orbits due to the emission of gravitational radiation. In this\u000acase, the lighter binary companion settles down to a stable orbit when the loss\u000aof the angular momentum due to gravitational radiation becomes equal to its\u000again from the accreting matter from the disk around the more massive primary.\u000aWe claim that such systems can be stable against small perturbations and can be\u000aregarded as steady emitters of gravitational waves of constant frequency and\u000aamplitude. Furthermore, X-rays emitted by the secondary can also produce\u000aastrophysically interesting situations when coupled with gravitational lensing\u000aand Doppler effects.\u000a

V  If gamma ray burst sources are in the galactic halo they inevitably involve a\u000acreation of an opaque pair plasma fireball, just like in cosmological sources.\u000aWe find that the typical physical conditions in a galactic halo fireball are:\u000aoptical depth $\u005cap 10^8$, thermal energy $\u005cap 100 KeV$, maximal relativstic\u000aexpansion $\u005cG \u005cap 300 $ and a maximal baryonic load of $\u005cap 10^{-15} M_\u005codot$.\u000aThis does not rule out galctic halo models but it poses an addtional severe\u000aconstraint on all such sources. A comparison of these conditions with the\u000aphysical conditions at cosmological fireballs reveal that galactic halo\u000afireballs are less favorable than cosmological ones as sources of gamma ray\u000abursts.\u000a

V  In a recent paper, we suggested that the density fluctuation spectra arising\u000afrom power-law (or extended) inflation, which are tilted with respect to the\u000aHarrison--Zel'dovich spectrum, may provide an explanation for the excess large\u000ascale clustering seen in galaxy surveys such as the APM survey. In the light of\u000athe new results from COBE, we examine in detail here cold dark matter\u000acosmogonies based on inflationary models predicting power-law spectra. Along\u000awith power-law and extended inflation, this class includes natural inflation.\u000aThe latter is of interest because, unlike the first two, it produces a\u000apower-law spectrum without significant gravitational wave production. We\u000aexamine a range of phenomena, including large angle microwave background\u000afluctuations, clustering in the galaxy distribution, bulk peculiar velocity\u000aflows, the formation of high redshift quasars and the epoch of structure\u000aformation. Of the three models, only natural inflation seems capable of\u000aexplaining the large scale clustering of optical galaxies. Such a model, though\u000aat best marginal even at present, has some advantages over standard CDM and on\u000amost grounds appears to perform at least as well. Power-law inflation's primary\u000ainterest may ultimately only be in permitting a larger bias parameter than\u000astandard CDM; it appears unable to explain excess clustering. Most models of\u000aextended inflation are ruled out at a high confidence level.\u000a

V  Reanalysis of Einstein IPC data and new observations from the GINGA\u000a  LAC indicate the presence of extended X-ray emission (10-50 kpc) around the\u000astarburst galaxy M82. Here we model this emission by calculating numerical\u000ahydrodynamic simulations of the starburst event to much later times and larger\u000ascales than previously considered. For our models, we adopt a supernova rate of\u000a0.1 ${\u005crm yr}^{-1}$, and an extended low-density static halo that is bound to\u000athe galaxy. There are three stages to the evolution of the wind-blown bubble\u000aand the propagation of the shock front: the bubble expands in an almost uniform\u000adensity disk gas, with a deceleration of the shock front ($t \u005calt $ 3.6 Myr);\u000abreakout from the disk and the upward acceleration of the shock front (3.6\u000a  Myr $\u005calt t \u005calt$ 18 Myr); propagation into the halo, leading to a more\u000aspherical system and shock deceleration (18 Myr $\u005calt t$). For a halo density\u000aof $10^{-3} {\u005crm cm}^{-3}$, the outflow reaches a distance of 40-50 kpc from\u000athe center of the starburst galaxy in 50 Myr. We calculate the time evolution\u000aof the X-ray luminosity and find that the extended starburst emits $3\u005ctimes\u000a10^{39}\u005clcgs$ to $10^{40}\u005clcgs$ in the\u000a  GINGA LAC band and $\u005csim 10^{41}\u005clcgs$ in the Einstein or ROSAT\u000a  HRI band. The degree of the ionization equilibrium in the outflow and its\u000aeffect on the iron K$\u005calpha$ line emission are discussed.\u000a

V  The effect of the magnetic skew on the Parker instability is investigated by\u000ameans of the linear stability analysis for a gravitationally stratified gas\u000alayer permeated by a horizontal magnetic field. When the magnetic field is\u000askewed (i.e., the field line direction is a function of the height), the\u000awavelength of the most unstable mode is $ \u005clambda \u005c; \u005csim \u005c; 10 H $ where $ H $\u000ais the pressure scale height. The growth rate of the short wavelength modes is\u000agreatly reduced when the gradient in the magnetic field direction exceeds 0.5\u000aradian per scale height. Our results indicate that the Parker instability in a\u000askewed magnetic field preferentially forms large scale structures like giant\u000amolecular clouds.\u000a

V  Global textures are interesting because they are promising candidates for\u000aseeds in the structure formation of the universe. The important configurations\u000aare those who will be able to collapse. The type of configurations that I will\u000aconsider are half knots and true knots. I define a half knot as one that covers\u000amore than a half-$S^3$, and a true knot as a configuration that covers the\u000awhole of $S^3$. Configurations that are half knots will be able to collapse, a\u000anew argument for this collapse criterion is given in this paper.

For a particular power spectrum, predicted Sachs-Wolfe effects are\u000acalculated for two cases: Gaussian (random phase) configuration, and a specific\u000akind of non-Gaussian configuration. We obtain a result that the Sachs-Wolfe\u000aeffect for the latter case is smaller when each temperature fluctuation is\u000aproperly normalized with respect to the corresponding mass fluctuation ${\u005cdelta\u000aM\u005cover M}(R)$.

We detect a very\u000abroad HeII$\u005clambda$4686 emission line component with twice the FWHM of the\u000aconventional broad line region (BLR) as evidenced by the Balmer lines. The\u000aprofile shape and centroid redshift also distinguish this HeII component from\u000athe BLR features. The large ratio of HeII\u005cl 4686 to any analogous H$\u005cbeta$\u000aemission component is an indicator that it arises in a very high density region\u000a($n_e \u005csimgt 10^{11}-10^{13}$ \u005ccm3).

Upper bounds on\u000a$\u005cdelta\u005crho/\u005crho$ require $\u005clambda < 10^{-13}$. Ratra has shown that an\u000aalternative treatment of reheating results in $\u005cdelta\u005crho/\u005crho \u005cpropto\u000a\u005clambda^{-1}$, so that an upper bound on $\u005cdelta\u005crho/\u005crho$ does not put an\u000aobvious upper bound on $\u005clambda$. We verify that $\u005cdelta\u005crho/\u005crho \u005cpropto\u000a\u005clambda^{-1}$ is indeed a possibility, but show that $\u005clambda < 10^{-13}$ is\u000astill required.\u000a

V  In this paper we have examined the age and internal dynamics of the young\u000abinary LMC cluster NGC 1850 using BV CCD images and echelle spectra of 52\u000asupergiants. Isochrone fits to a BV color-magnitude diagram revealed that the\u000aprimary cluster has an age of $\u005ctau = 90 \u005cpm 30$ Myr while the secondary member\u000ahas $\u005ctau = 6 \u005cpm 5$ Myr. BV surface brightness profiles were constructed out\u000ato R $>$ 40 pc, and single-component King-Michie (KM) models were applied. The\u000atotal cluster luminosity varied from L$_B$ = 2.60 - 2.65 $\u005ctimes 10^6$\u000aL$_B$\u005csol\u005c and L$_V$ = 1.25 - 1.35 $\u005ctimes 10^6$ as the anisotropy radius\u000avaried from infinity to three times the scale radius with the isotropic models\u000aproviding the best agreement with the data. Of the 52 stars with echelle\u000aspectra, a subset of 36 were used to study the cluster dynamics. The KM radial\u000avelocity distributions were fitted to these velocities yielding total cluster\u000amasses of 5.4 - 5.9 $\u005cpm 2.4 \u005ctimes 10^4$ M\u005csol\u005c corresponding to M/L$_B$ =\u000a0.02 $\u005cpm 0.01$ M\u005csol/L$_B$\u005csol\u005c or M/L$_V$ = 0.05 $\u005cpm 0.02$ M\u005csol/L$_V$\u005csol.\u000aA rotational signal in the radial velocities has been detected at the 93\u005c%\u000aconfidence level implying a rotation axis at a position angle of 100\u005cdeg. A\u000avariety of rotating models were fit to the velocity data assuming cluster\u000aellipticities of $\u005cepsilon = 0.1 - 0.3$. These models provided slightly better\u000aagreement with the radial velocity data than the KM models and had masses that\u000awere systematically lower by a few percent. The preferred value for the slope\u000aof a power-law IMF is a relatively shallow, $x = 0.29 \u005cpmm{+0.3}{-0.8}$\u000aassuming the B-band M/L or $x = 0.71 \u005cpmm{+0.2}{-0.4}$ for the V-band.\u000a

V  If $\u005cnu_\u005cmu$ or $\u005cnu_\u005ctau$ mix with $\u005cnu_e$, neutrino oscillations and\u000acollisions in a supernova (SN) core allow these flavors effectively to\u000aparticipate in $\u005cbeta$ equilibrium and thus to obtain a large chemical\u000apotential. If a sterile species mixes with $\u005cnu_e$, these effects lead to an\u000aanomalous loss of energy and lepton number. We study flavor conversion in a SN\u000acore on the basis of a new kinetic equation which rigorously includes neutrino\u000ainterference and degeneneracy effects. Our discussion serves as an example and\u000aillustration of the properties of this ``non-abelian Boltzmann equation''.\u000a

Demanding that these gravitational effects not affet the axion\u000asolution to the strong CP problem, we find that at least two sets of quarks\u000awith differing Peccei-Quinn charges are required.

We calculate this entropy in a\u000aspecific cosmological model (the inflationary Universe) and find that on scales\u000aof interest in cosmology the entropy in both density perturbations and\u000agravitational waves exceeds the entropy of statistical fluctuations of the\u000amicrowave background.

A comparison of\u000athe energy spectrum for cosmic rays at the source and $\u005cgamma$-rays from\u000aquasars obtained recently by CGRO (Compton Gamma Ray Observatory) indicates\u000athat the prediction is in agreement with the data in the average sense. This\u000asuggests that neutrinos from point sources should have a spectral index\u000aidentical to that of $\u005cgamma$-rays for an individual point source. This\u000aprediction is also consistent with the recent observation of neutrinos by\u000aKamiokande and IMB in which the ratio of $\u005cnu_\u005cmu/\u005cnu_e$ is close to 1, instead\u000aof 2 as expected from atmospheric neutrinos.

V  The cosmological significance of the neutralino sector is studied for a class\u000aof models in which electroweak symmetry breaking is seeded by a gauge singlet.\u000aExtensive use is made of the renormalisation group equations to significantly\u000areduce the parameter space, by deriving analytic expressions for all the\u000asupersymmetry-breaking couplings in terms of the universal gaugino mass\u000a$m_{1/2}$, the universal scalar mass $m_0$ and the coupling $A$. The\u000acomposition of the LSP is determined exactly below the W mass, no\u000aapproximations are made for sfermion masses, and all particle exchanges are\u000aconsidered in calculating the annihilation cross-section; the relic abundance\u000ais then obtained by an analytic approximation. We find that in these models,\u000astable neutralinos may make a significant contribution to the dark matter in\u000athe universe.\u000a

V  We have modified the standard code for primordial nucleosynthesis to include\u000athe effect of the slight heating of neutrinos by $e^\u005cpm$ annihilations. There\u000ais a small, systematic change in the $^4$He yield, $\u005cDelta Y \u005csimeq +1.5\u005ctimes\u000a10^{-4}$, which is insensitive to the value of the baryon-to-photon ratio\u000a$\u005ceta$ for $10^{-10}\u005cla \u005ceta \u005cla 10^{-9}$. We also find that the\u000abaryon-to-photon ratio decreases by about 0.5\u005c% less than the canonical factor\u000aof 4/11 because some of the entropy in $e^\u005cpm$ pairs is transferred to\u000aneutrinos. These results are in accord with recent analytical estimates.\u000a

V  We consider the ultra light pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson appearing in the\u000alate time cosmological phase transition theories as a dark matter candidate.\u000aSince it is almost massless, its nature is more wave like than particle like.\u000aHence we apply quantum mechanics to study how they form the galactic halos.\u000aThree predictions are made; (1)the mass profile $\u005crho\u005csim r^{-1.6}$, (2)there\u000aare ripple-like fine structures in rotation curve, (3) the rotation velocity\u000atimes ripple's wave length is largely galaxy independent. We compare the\u000arotation curves predicted by our theory with the data observed.\u000a

V  The origin of seed perturbations in the Universe is studied within the\u000aframework of a specific minisuperspace model. It is shown that the `creation'\u000aof the Universe as a result of a quantum transition from a flat empty spacetime\u000awould lead to a flat FLRW (Friedmann Lema\u005c^\u005ci tre Robertson-Walker) Universe\u000awith weak inhomogeneous perturbations at large wavelengths. The power spectrum\u000aof these perturbations is found to be scale invariant at horizon crossing\u000a(i.e., the Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum). It is also recognised that the seed\u000aperturbations generated in our model would be generically of the isocurvature\u000akind.\u000a

V  The galactic magnetic field is commonly supposed to be due to a dynamo acting\u000aon some large scale seed field. A major difficulty with this idea is that\u000aestimates of reasonable seed field strengths tend to be quite low, on the order\u000aof $\u005csim10^{-20}$ gauss. Here we examine the contribution due to the flux\u000aentrained in winds from protostars formed in the first dynamo e-folding time of\u000aa galaxy's existence. Using a minimal estimate of a protostellar magnetic field\u000awe find that if each protostar ejects a single current ring, sufficient to\u000amaintain flux freezing in the wind, than the large scale average dipole field\u000afrom all such current rings will be at least 5 orders of magnitude larger than\u000aprevious seed field estimates. Allowing for a reasonable amount of magnetic\u000aactivity in protostars during an extended period of mass loss increases this to\u000aa dipole seed field of $\u005csim10^{-12}$ gauss. For the purposes of producing a\u000aseed field it is irrelevant whether or not this initial injection of flux takes\u000aplace in a newly formed galactic disk, or in star forming proto-galactic\u000aclouds. The compression of this dipole field into a thin disk will lead to a\u000alarge scale $B_r\u005csim 10^{-10.5}$ gauss. Initially, field strengths on smaller\u000ascales will be larger, but nowhere near current levels.\u000a

V  As part of a stellar population sampling program, a series of photometric\u000aprobes at various field sizes and depths have been obtained in a low extinction\u000awindow in the galactic anticentre direction. Such data set strong constraints\u000aon the radial structure of the disc. At the forefront of this "drilling"\u000aprogram, very deep CCD frames probe the most external parts of the disc. Over\u000athe whole effective magnitude range (18 to 25), all contributions in the\u000astatistics which should be expected from old disc stars beyond 6 kpc vanish,\u000aalthough such stars dominate by far at distances less than 5 kpc. This is the\u000asignature of a sharp cut-off in the star density: the edge of the galactic disc\u000abetween 5.5 and 6 kpc. As a consequence, the galactic radius does not exceed 14\u000akpc (assuming $R/-/(//sun/)$=8.5). Colours of elliptical galaxies measured in\u000athe field rule out the risk of being misled by undetected extinction.\u000a

V  The average flux decrement shortward the Ly$_{\u005calpha}$ emission, due to the\u000awell-known ``forest'' of absorptions, has been measured in the spectra of 8\u000aquasars. Quasi-simultaneous optical and IUE observations of the two low\u000aredshift quasars PKS 0637--75 (z=0.654) and MC 1104+16 (z=0.632) have been\u000acarried out, obtaining relatively high S/N, spectrophotometrically calibrated\u000adata on their energy distribution from the rest frame H$_{\u005cbeta}$ to the Lyman\u000acontinuum. Six more quasars in the redshift range 2.5-3.4 have been observed in\u000athe optical domain. For all the quasars the ``intrinsic'' continuum slope and\u000anormalization have been estimated longward the Ly$_{\u005calpha}$ emission and\u000aextrapolated towards the Lyman continuum to measure the average depressions,\u000awhich have been compared with the model statistics of the Ly$_{\u005calpha}$ clouds.\u000aWhen all the known classes of absorbers are taken into account with plausible\u000avalues for their equivalent width distribution and evolution, a good agreement\u000ais obtained with the observations. The results for the observed continuum\u000adecrement at $z \u005csim 0.65$ are identical to those predicted by the evolution\u000awith redshift of the number of Ly$_{\u005calpha}$ forest systems including the HST\u000adata and within $2\u005csigma$ of the predicted value using the ``standard''\u000aLy$_{\u005calpha}$ evolution (as determined only at high z).\u000a
