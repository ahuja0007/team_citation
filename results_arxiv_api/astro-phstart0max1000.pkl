V  It is proved that the field of a gravitational lens induces no rotation in\u000athe polarization vector of electromagnetic radiation, in agreement with the\u000aprevious literature, but with a different approach. The result is generalized\u000ato the case of less conventional gravitational lenses (static cosmic strings\u000aand gravitational waves).\u000a

V  Velocity dispersion $\u005csigma$, radius $R$ and luminosity $L$ of elliptical\u000agalaxies are known to be related, leaving only two degrees of freedom and\u000adefining the so-called ``fundamental plane". In this {\u005cem Letter} we present\u000aobservational evidence that rich galaxy clusters exhibit a similar behaviour.\u000aAssuming a relation $L \u005cpropto R^{\u005calpha}\u005csigma^{2 \u005cbeta}$, the best-fit values\u000aof $\u005calpha$ and $\u005cbeta$ are very close to those defined by galaxies. The\u000adispersion of this relation is lower than 10 percent, i.e. significantly\u000asmaller than the dispersion observed in the $L-\u005csigma$ and $L-R$ relations. We\u000abriefly suggest some possible implications on the spread of formation times of\u000aobjects and on peculiar velocities of galaxy clusters.\u000a

V  We present the results of a short time scale monitoring of SiO maser emission\u000a(v=1 J=1-0 transition) in four known strong sources. These sources were\u000amonitored nightly for a period of about a month. The aim of these observations\u000ais to investigate the possible presence of variations in the maser lines on\u000atime scales of a few days to weeks, due to sound waves propagating out from the\u000acentral star. If sound waves are responsible for the mass loss of certain cool\u000agiants, as suggested by Pijpers and Hearn (1989) and Pijpers and Habing (1989),\u000alocal variations in density and relative velocity are expected just above the\u000astellar photosphere. These could give rise to variations in any narrow spectral\u000aline formed in this region, and therefore in particular in the SiO maser lines.\u000aOur observations indicate that variations in the line shape (leading to\u000arelative changes in the intensity of about 20\u005c%) occur in the SiO emission of\u000aMira type stars, within short time scales of 10-20 days. The main component of\u000athe profile variability is consistent with a displacement of the velocity\u000acentroid of the dominant maser peaks, by about 1 km s$^{-1}$ in the average.\u000aApparent variations in the total line flux were also found, but could be\u000apartially due to calibration uncertainties.\u000a

V  The observed spatial distribution of $\u005cgamma-$ray bursts indicates that they\u000aprobably originate at cosmological distances. At this distance scale their\u000avariability timescale and flux above MeV imply an initial optical-depth to pair\u000aproduction $> 10^{10}$. This appears to be in conflict with their highly\u000anon-thermal spectra. We show that this difficulty can be removed if axion\u000abursts from supernovae are converted to $\u005cgamma-$rays over cosmological\u000adistances. Nonthermal bursts with the relevant flux, duration, variability and\u000aspectra are obtained just for the range of axion masses of $10^{-5}-10^{-4}{\u005crm\u000aeV}$ that accounts for the cold dark matter in the universe. The observed rate\u000aof $\u005cgamma-$ray bursts implies that axions should be converted efficiently to\u000aphotons in only one out of $\u005csim 10^{4}$ supernovae.\u000a

V  Small number statistics may heavily affect the structure of the broadening\u000afunction in integrated spectra of galactic globular cluster centers. As a\u000aconsequence, it is a priori unknown how closely line broadening measure- ments\u000agauge the intrinsic velocity dispersions at the cores of these stel- lar\u000asystems. We have tackled this general problem by means of Monte Carlo\u000asimulations. An examination of the mode and the frequency distribution of the\u000ameasured values of the simulations indicates that the low value measured for\u000athe velocity dispersion of M30 (Zaggia etal 1992) is likely a reliable estimate\u000aof the velocity dispersion at the center of this cluster. The same methodology\u000aapplied to the case of M15 suggests that the steep inward rise of the velocity\u000adispersion found by Peterson, Seitzer and Cudworth (1989) is real, although\u000aless pronounced. Large-aperture observa- tions are less sensitive to\u000astatistical fluctuations, but are unable to detect strong variations in the\u000adispersion wich occur within the aperture itself.\u000a

V  (accepted for publication in the Ap.J.) I present a general classification of\u000aself-similar solutions to the equations of gravitational hydrodynamics that\u000acontain many previous results as special cases. For cold flows with spherical\u000asymmetry, the solution space can be classified into several regions of behavior\u000asimilar to the Bondi solutions for steady flow. A full description of these\u000asolution is possible, which serves as the asymptotic limit for the general\u000aproblem. By applying a shock jump condition, exact general solutions can be\u000aconstructed. The isothermal case allows an extra exact integral, and can be\u000aasymptotically analyzed in the presence of finite pressure. These solutions\u000aserve as analytic models for problems such as spherical accretion for star\u000aformation, infall or outflow of gas into galaxies, Lyman alpha cloud dynamics,\u000aetc. Most previous self-similar results are obtained as special cases. The\u000acritical values for a cosmological flow with $\u005cOmega=1$ and $\u005cgamma=4/3$ turn\u000aout to play a special role.\u000a

V  In an attempt to understand the properties of convective energy transport in\u000athe solar convection zone, a numerical model has been constructed for turbulent\u000aflows in a compressible, radiation-coupled, non-magnetic, gravitationally\u000astratified medium using a realistic equation of state and realistic opacities.\u000aThe time-dependent, three-dimensional hydrodynamic equations are solved with\u000aminimal simplifications.\u000a  The statistical information obtained from the present simulation provides an\u000aimproved understanding of solar photospheric convection. The characteristics of\u000asolar convection in shallow regions is parameterized and compared with the\u000aresults of Chan and Sofia's simulations of deep and efficient convection (Chan\u000aand Sofia 1989). We assess the importance of the zones of partial ionization in\u000athe simulation, and confirm that the radiative energy transfer is negligible\u000athroughout the region except in the uppermost scale heights of the convection\u000azone, a region of very high super-adiabaticity.\u000a  When the effects of partial ionization are included, the dynamics of flows\u000aare altered significantly. However, we confirm the Chan and Sofia result that\u000akinetic energy flux is non-negligible and can have a negative value in the\u000aconvection zone.\u000a

V  The FIRAS instrument on the COBE satellite has conducted an unbiased survey\u000aof the far-infrared emission from our Galaxy. The first results of this survey\u000awere reported by Wright et al. (1991). We report the results of new analyses of\u000athis spectral survey, which includes emission lines from 158 um C+, 122 um and\u000a205 um N+, 370 um and 609 um C, and CO J=2-1 through 5-4. We report the\u000amorphological distribution along the galactic plane (b=0) of the spectral line\u000aemission, and the high galactic latitude intensities of the C+ and 205 um N+\u000aemission. The high galactic latitude intensity cosecant of the 158 um fine\u000astructure transition from C+ is presented, and C+ is seen to decrease more\u000arapidly than the far infrared intensity with increasing galactic latitude. C+\u000aand H I emission are closely correlated with a C+ cooling rate of (2.65 +/-\u000a0.15)x10^{-26} erg/s/H-atom. We conclude that this emission arises almost\u000aentirely from the Cold Neutral Medium. The high galactic latitude intensity of\u000athe 205 um fine structure transition from N+ arises entirely from the Warm\u000aIonized Medium, and its cosecant is presented. We estimate the total ionizing\u000aphoton rate in the Galaxy to be 3.5x10^{53} ionizing photons per second, based\u000aon the 205 um N+ transition.\u000a

V  A formalism is presented that allows cosmological experiments to be tested\u000afor consistency, and allows a simple frequentist interpretation of the\u000aresulting significance levels. As an example of an application, this formalism\u000ais used to place constraints on bulk flows of galaxies using the results of the\u000amicrowave background anisotropy experiments COBE and SP91, and a few\u000asimplifying approximations about the experimental window functions. It is found\u000athat if taken at face value, with the quoted errors, the recent detection by\u000aLauer and Postman of a bulk flow of 689 km/s on scales of 150$h^{-1}$Mpc is\u000ainconsistent with SP91 at a 95\u005c% confidence level within the framework of a\u000aCold Dark Matter (CDM) model. The same consistency test is also used to place\u000aconstraints that are completely model-independent, in the sense that they hold\u000afor any power spectrum whatsoever --- the only assumption being that the random\u000afields are Gaussian. It is shown that the resulting infinite-dimensional\u000aoptimization problem reduces to a set of coupled non-linear equations that can\u000areadily be solved numerically. Applying this technique to the above-mentioned\u000aexample, we find that the Lauer and Postman result is inconsistent with SP91\u000aeven if no assumptions whatsoever are made about the power spectrum.\u000a

V  A Massive Compact Halo Object (Macho) that lenses a background star will\u000amagnify different parts of the rotating stellar disk by varying amounts. The\u000adifferential magnification will cause a shift in the centroid of the star's\u000aspectral lines during the lensing event. The shift is proportional to the ratio\u000aof the stellar radius to the projected separation of the Macho from the star.\u000aIt therefore provides a direct measure of the Einstein ring radius, and so also\u000aa measure of the Macho's proper motion (angular speed). This measurement can\u000aremove some of the degeneracy between mass, distance to the lens, and\u000atransverse velocity that exists in the interpretation of results from ongoing\u000amicrolensing experiments, and is an independent test of the lensing nature of\u000athe event. We show that using the high precision attainable by stellar radial\u000avelocity measurements, it is possible to measure proper motions for $\u005csim 10\u005c%$\u000aof Machos that lens A-stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), i.e.\u005c $\u005csim\u000a7\u005c%$ of the type of relatively high-magnification events that have been\u000areported to date. If this proper-motion measurement were combined with a\u000aparallax measurement of the ``reduced velocity'', then the Macho mass,\u000adistance, speed, and direction could each be separately determined. The shift\u000acan be measured for $\u005csim 20\u005c%$ of the A-star events generated by Machos in the\u000adark halo of the LMC. This in turn would provide a measurement of the fraction\u000aof LMC vs. Galactic Macho events.\u000a

V  I address the question of whether supersymmetry provides a viable candidate\u000afor the dark matter in the Universe. I review the properties of the lightest\u000aneutralino as a candidate for solving the dark matter problem. I discuss the\u000aneutralino's phenomenological and cosmological properties, and constraints from\u000apresent and future experiments. In the minimal supersymmetric model, the\u000aneutralino mass has been experimentally excluded below some $20$ GeV, and is\u000anot expected to be significantly larger than about $150$ GeV. I identify a\u000agaugino-like neutralino as the most natural dark matter candidate for a\u000aplausible range of parameters. The requirement that the lightest neutralino be\u000athe dominant matter component in the flat Universe provides non-trivial\u000arestrictions on other parameters of the model, in particular on the masses of\u000athe sfermions. Next, I study the consequences of adopting further grand\u000aunification assumptions. In both scenarios I find sfermion masses most likely\u000abeyond the reach of LEP 200 and the Tevatron but well within the discovery\u000apotential of the SSC and the LHC. I also comment on the effects of relaxing\u000agrand unification assumptions. Finally, I briefly outline prospects for the\u000aneutralino dark matter searches.\u000a

V  Radiation of both the outer gaps and the neutron star surface is considered\u000afor a Vela-like pulsar near the death line. It is shown that if such a pulsar\u000ais close enough to the death line, its optical, UV and X-ray emission has to\u000aincrease. Using results of this consideration, it is argued that Geminga is not\u000aa close relative of Vela-like pulsars. The outer gap model of Geminga in which\u000athe main part of the outer gap volume operates as a Vela-like generator of\u000a$\u005cgamma$-rays is ruled out. A Vela-like mechanism of $\u005cgamma$-ray generation\u000acan operate only in a small region of the outer gap of Geminga. The length of\u000athis region along the magnetic field is an order of magnitude smaller than the\u000aouter gap dimensions. In the magnetosphere of Geminga the main mechanism of\u000a$\u005cgamma$-ray generation at $\u005csim 10 - 10^4$ MeV is curvature radiation and not\u000athe synchrotron radiation as it was assumed for Vela-like pulsars.\u000a

V  To try and confirm the types of object in the list of 2298 potential HII\u000aregions identified by Hughes \u005c& MacLeod from the IRAS Point Source Catalog, we\u000aselected a sample of 82 for observing at the VLA. We selected half with values\u000aof Y = log(F$_{25}$/F$_{12}$) $\u005cgeq$ 0.8, and for control purposes, half with\u000avalues of 0.3 $\u005cleq$ log(F$_{25}$/F$_{12}$) $\u005cleq$ 0.5. 78 radio sources were\u000adetected, and of all the objects, 72\u005c% had at least one associated radio\u000asource. Most of the radio sources had diameters of $<$ 3\u005carcsec, which was the\u000alimit to the angular resolving power of the survey. Those with larger values of\u000aY had significantly larger values of peak radio, integrated radio, and\u000a100$\u005cmu$m flux densities than those with smaller Y. Also, they generally had\u000aassociated masers, and thus were most likely young compact HII regions\u000acontaining star forming regions. Those with smaller Y tended not to have\u000aassociated maser activity and are probably older HII regions, or stars with\u000ahigh IR and ionizing radiation, such as T-Tauri type stars. However, all 2298\u000aobjects appear to have a strong galactic concentration. Some comparison is made\u000awith the selection of 1717 objects identified by Wood \u005c& Churchwell as HII\u000aregions, but their selection criteria were somewhat different, and they\u000aactually form a subset of ours.\u000a

V  An effective chiral Lagrangian in heavy-fermion formalism whose parameters\u000aare constrained by kaon-nucleon and kaon-nuclear interactions next to the\u000aleading order in chiral expansion is used to describe kaon condensation in\u000adense ``neutron star" matter.

Once kaon condensation sets in, the system is no\u000alonger composed of neutron matter but of nuclear matter. Possible consequences\u000aon stellar collapse with the formation of compact ``nuclear stars" or\u000alight-mass black holes are pointed out.\u000a

V  We analyze the ultraviolet (UV) emission line and continuum properties of\u000afive low-redshift active galactic nuclei (four luminous quasars:\u000aPKS~0405$-$123, H1821+643, PG~0953+414, and 3C273, and one bright Seyfert 1\u000agalaxy: Mrk~205). The HST spectra have higher signal-to-noise ratios (typically\u000a$\u005csim 60$ per resolution element) and spectral resolution ($R = 1300$) than all\u000apreviously- published UV spectra used to study the emission characteristics of\u000aactive galactic nuclei. We include in the analysis ground-based optical spectra\u000acovering \u005chb\u005c and the narrow [O III] $\u005clambda\u005clambda$4959,5007 doublet. The\u000afollowing new results are obtained: \u005clyb/\u005clya=0.03$-$0.12 for the four quasars,\u000awhich is the first accurate measurement of the long-predicted \u005clyb\u005c intensity\u000ain QSOs. The cores of \u005clya\u005c and C~IV are symmetric to an accuracy of better\u000athan\u000a  2.5% within about 2000 km s$^{-1}$ of the line peak. This high degree of\u000asymmetry of \u005clya\u005c argues against models in which the broad line cloud velocity\u000afield has a significant radial component. The observed smoothness of the \u005clya\u005c\u000aand C~IV line profiles requires at least $\u005csim 10^4$ individual clouds if bulk\u000avelocity is the only line-broadening mechanism. The overall similarity of the\u000a\u005clya\u005c and C IV $\u005clambda$1549 profiles rules out models for the broad line\u000aregion (BLR) with a radial distribution of virialized....\u000a

V  We use high resolution dissipationless N-body simulations to examine the\u000aspatial distribution of galaxy clusters on large scales. The Standard CDM model\u000aand two of its main competitors, Low density CDM and Mixed Dark Matter are\u000acompared.The two-point correlation function of simulated clusters is compared\u000awith an extended survey of APM clusters , and it is found that Standard CDM\u000aexhibits a lack of power on all scales, whereas the two alternative scenarios\u000aare able to match the spatial correlations well. Of the remaining two\u000amodels,the velocities in the MDM universe have a higher amplitude and their\u000adistribution is much broader. We compare these peculiar velocities with\u000aobservations and find that both models have difficulty in reproducing the\u000aobserved numbers of very high peculiar velocity clusters. The reliable\u000adetection of several more clusters with velocities in excess of 1000 km/s would\u000arender the LCDM scenario in particular very unlikely.\u000a

V  Recently, the possibility has emerged of an early detection of astrophysical\u000agravity waves. In certain astronomical configurations, and through a new\u000alight-deflection effect, gravity waves can cause apparent shifts in stellar\u000aangular positions as large as $10^{-7}arcsec$. In these same configurations,\u000athe magnitude of the gravity-wave-induced time-delay effect can exceed\u000a$10^{-14}$. Both these figures lie just at present-day theoretical limits of\u000adetectability. For instance, cases are described where the very faint\u000aneutron-star gravity waves could soon become detectable. The detection meant\u000ahere involves direct observations of the very wave-forms.\u000a

V  We investigate the clustering of galaxies in the QDOT redshift survey of IRAS\u000agalaxies. We find that the redshift space two-point correlation function is\u000awell approximated by a power-law of slope -1.11+\u005c-0.09, with clustering length\u000a3.87+\u005c-0.32 Mpc/h out to pair separations of 25 Mpc\u005ch. On scales larger than 40\u000aMpc/h, the correlation function is consistent with zero. The r.m.s. fluctuation\u000ain the count of QDOT galaxies above the Poisson level in spheres of radius 8\u000aMpc/h is \u005csigma_8^{IRAS}=0.58+\u005c-0.14, showing that fluctuations in the\u000adistribution of IRAS galaxies on these scales are smaller than those of optical\u000agalaxies by a factor of about 0.65, with an uncertainty of 25%. We find no\u000adetectable difference between the correlation functions measured in redshift\u000aspace and in real space, leading to a $2\u005csigma$ limit of b_{IRAS}/\u005cOmega^{0.6}\u000a>1.05, where b_{IRAS} is the bias factor for IRAS galaxies and \u005cOmega is the\u000acosmological density parameter. The QDOT autocorrelation function calculated in\u000aconcentric shells increases significantly with shell radius. This difference is\u000amore likely due to sampling fluctuations than to an increase of the clustering\u000astrength with galaxy luminosity, but the two effects are difficult to\u000adisentangle; our data allow at most an increase of \u005csim 20% in clustering\u000astrength for each decade in luminosity. For separations greater than \u005csim 3\u000aMpc/h, the cross-correlation function of Abell clusters (with Richness R\u005cge 1)\u000aand QDOT galaxies is well approximated by a power-law of slope -1.81+\u005c-0.10,\u000awith clustering length 10.10+\u005c-0.45 Mpc/h, and no significant signal beyond\u000a\u005cgsim 50 Mpc\u005ch. This cross-correlation depends only weakly on cluster richness.\u000a

V  One method to reconstruct the scalar field potential of inflation is a\u000aperturbative approach, where the values of the potential and its derivatives\u000aare calculated as an expansion in departures from the slow-roll approximation.\u000aThey can then be expressed in terms of observable quantities, such as the\u000asquare of the ratio of the gravitational wave amplitude to the density\u000aperturbation amplitude, the deviation of the spectral index from the\u000aHarrison--Zel'dovich value, etc. Here, we calculate complete expressions for\u000athe second-order contributions to the coefficients of the expansion by\u000aincluding for the first time corrections to the standard expressions for the\u000aperturbation spectra. As well as offering an improved result, these corrections\u000aindicate the expected accuracy of the reconstruction. Typically the corrections\u000aare only a few percent.\u000a

V  I review a number of tests of theories for structure formation. Large-scale\u000aflows and IRAS galaxies indicate a high density parameter $\u005cOmega \u005csimeq 1$, in\u000aaccord with inflationary predictions, but it is not clear how this meshes with\u000athe uniformly low values obtained from virial analysis on scales $\u005csim$ 1Mpc.\u000aGravitational distortion of faint galaxies behind clusters allows one to\u000aconstruct maps of the mass surface density, and this should shed some light on\u000athe large vs small-scale $\u005cOmega$ discrepancy. Power spectrum analysis reveals\u000atoo red a spectrum (compared to standard CDM) on scales $\u005clambda \u005csim 10-100$\u000a$h^{-1}$Mpc, but the gaussian fluctuation hypothesis appears to be in good\u000ashape. These results suggest that the problem for CDM lies not in the very\u000aearly universe --- the inflationary predictions of $\u005cOmega = 1$ and gaussianity\u000aboth seem to be OK; furthermore, the COBE result severely restricts\u000amodifications such as tilting the primordial spectrum --- but in the assumed\u000amatter content. The power spectrum problem can be solved by invoking a cocktail\u000aof mixed dark matter. However, if gravitational lensing fails to reveal\u000aextended dark mass around clusters then we may be forced to explore more\u000aradical possibilities for the dark matter.\u000a

V  We investigate chaotic inflation models with two scalar fields, such that one\u000afield (the inflaton) rolls while the other is trapped in a false vacuum state.\u000aThe false vacuum becomes unstable when the inflaton field falls below some\u000acritical value, and a first or second order transition to the true vacuum\u000aensues. Particular attention is paid to Linde's second-order `Hybrid\u000aInflation'; with the false vacuum dominating, inflation differs from the usual\u000atrue vacuum case both in its cosmology and in its relation to particle physics.\u000aThe spectral index of the adiabatic density perturbation can be very close to\u000a1, or it can be around ten percent higher. The energy scale at the end of\u000ainflation can be anywhere between $10^{16}$\u005c,GeV and $10^{11}$\u005c,GeV, though\u000areheating is prompt so the reheat temperature can't be far below\u000a$10^{11}\u005c,$GeV. Topological defects are almost inevitably produced at the end\u000aof inflation, and if the inflationary energy scale is near its upper limit they\u000acan have significant effects.\u000a  Because false vacuum inflation occurs with the inflaton field far below the\u000aPlanck scale, it is easier to implement in the context of supergravity than\u000astandard chaotic inflation. That the inflaton mass is small compared with the\u000ainflationary Hubble parameter is still a problem for generic supergravity\u000atheories, but remarkably this can be avoided in a natural way for a class of\u000asupergravity models which follow from orbifold compactification of\u000asuperstrings. This opens up the prospect of a truly realistic, superstring\u000a

V  Boson stars consist of a system of self-gravitating scalar fields which form\u000aa macroscopic quantum state and are a possible dark matter candidate. In this\u000apaper, we address the existence of boson stars in Brans-Dicke gravity. We show\u000athat solutions to the equations of motion of a boson star in Brans-Dicke\u000agravity exist for different values of the coupling constant $\u005cLambda=\u005clambda\u000aM_{Pl}^2/4\u005cpi m^2$, where $\u005clambda$ is the quartic coupling, and $m$ the mass\u000aof the boson field. We find that there is only a small decrease of a few\u000apercent in the mass of these objects when compared to similar solutions based\u000aon general relativity. We also consider solutions in the limit as $\u005cLambda\u000a\u005crightarrow\u005cinfty$.\u000a

V  We examine the damping of non-linear sub-horizon scale entropy fluctuations\u000ain early epochs of the universe ($T\u005capprox 100$ GeV to $T\u005capprox 1$keV) by\u000aneutrino, baryon, and photon induced dissipative processes. Results of\u000anumerical evolution calculations are presented for broad ranges of initial\u000afluctuation amplitudes and length scales. These calculations include a detailed\u000atreatment of neutrino inflation, neutron and proton diffusion, photon diffusive\u000aheat transport, and hydrodynamic expansion with photon-electron Thomson drag.\u000aNeutrino inflation is treated both in the diffusive heat transport regime where\u000aneutrinos are optically thick on the length scales of the fluctuations, and in\u000athe homogeneous heating regime where neutrinos are optically thin on these\u000ascales. We find considerable convergence in amplitude evolution for appreciable\u000aranges in initial fluctuation length scales and amplitudes. Fluctuations\u000aproduced with the right characteristics at very early times ($T$ $^>_{\u005csim}$\u000a100 GeV) are found to survive through the nucleosynthesis epoch.\u000a

V  A new, fully dynamic and self-consistent radiation hydrodynamics code,\u000asuitable for the calculation of supernovae light curves and continuum spectra,\u000ais described. It is a multigroup (frequency-dependent) code and includes all\u000aimportant $O(v/c)$ effects. It is applied to the model W7 of Nomoto,\u000aThielemann, \u005c& Yokoi (1984) for supernovae of type Ia. Radioactive energy\u000adeposition is incorporated through use of tables based upon Monte Carlo\u000aresults. Effects of line opacity (both static or line blanketing and expansion\u000aor line blocking) are neglected, although these may prove to be important. At\u000amaximum light, models based upon different treatments of the opacity lead to\u000avalues for $M_{B,max}$ in the range of -19.0 to -19.4. This range falls between\u000athe values for observed supernova claimed by Leibundgut \u005c& Tammann (1990) and\u000aby Pierce, Ressler, \u005c& Shure (1992).\u000a

V  Any quantum theory of gravity which treats the gravitational constant as a\u000adynamical variable has to address the issue of superpositions of states\u000acorresponding to different eigenvalues. We show how the unobservability of such\u000asuperpositions can be explained through the interaction with other\u000agravitational degrees of freedom (decoherence). The formal framework is\u000acanonically quantized Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory. We discuss the concepts of\u000aintrinsic time and semiclassical time as well as the possibility of tunneling\u000ainto regions corresponding to a negative gravitational constant. We calculate\u000athe reduced density matrix of the Jordan-Brans-Dicke field and show that the\u000aoff-diagonal elements can be sufficiently suppressed to be consistent with\u000aexperiments. The possible relevance of this mechanism for structure formation\u000ain extended inflation is briefly discussed.\u000a

V  We report results from high-resolution particle-mesh (PM) N-body simulations\u000aof structure formation in an $\u005cOmega=1$ cosmological model with a mixture of\u000aCold plus Hot Dark Matter (C+HDM) having $\u005cOmega_{\u005crm cold}=0.6$,\u000a$\u005cOmega_\u005cnu=0.3$, and $\u005cOmega_{\u005crm baryon}=0.1$. We present analytic fits to\u000athe C+HDM power spectra for both cold and hot ($\u005cnu$) components, which provide\u000ainitial conditions for our nonlinear simulations. In order to sample the\u000aneutrino velocities adequately, these simulations included six times as many\u000aneutrino particles as cold particles. Our simulation boxes were 14, 50, and\u000a200~Mpc cubes (with $H_0=50$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$); we also did comparison\u000asimulations for Cold Dark Matter (CDM) in a 50~Mpc box. C+HDM with linear bias\u000afactor $b=1.5$ is consistent both with the COBE data and with the galaxy\u000acorrelations we calculate. We find the number of halos as a function of mass\u000aand redshift in our simulations; our results for both CDM and C+HDM are well\u000afit by a Press-Schechter model. The number density of galaxy-mass halos is\u000asmaller than for CDM, especially at redshift $z>2$, but the numbers of\u000acluster-mass halos are comparable. We also find that on galaxy scales the\u000aneutrino velocities and flatter power spectrum in C+HDM result in galaxy\u000apairwise velocities that are in good agreement with the data, and about 30\u005c%\u000asmaller than in CDM with the same biasing factor. On scales of several tens of\u000aMpc, the C+HDM streaming velocities are considerably larger than CDM. Thus\u000aC+HDM looks promising as a model of structure formation.\u000a

V  We study the quasilinear evolution of the one-point probability density\u000afunctions (PDFs) of the smoothed density and velocity fields in a cosmological\u000agravitating system beginning with Gaussian initial fluctuations. Our analytic\u000aresults are based on the Zel'dovich approximation and laminar flow. A numerical\u000aanalysis extends the results into the multistreaming regime using the smoothed\u000afields of a CDM N-body simulation. We find that the PDF of velocity, both\u000aLagrangian and Eulerian, remains Gaussian under the laminar Zel'dovich\u000aapproximation, and it is almost indistinguishable from Gaussian in the\u000asimulations. The PDF of mass density deviates from a normal distribution early\u000ain the quasilinear regime and it develops a shape remarkably similar to a\u000alognormal distribution with one parameter, the \u005crms density fluctuation\u000a$\u005csigma$. Applying these results to currently available data we find that the\u000aPDFs of the velocity and density fields, as recovered by the \u005cpot\u005c procedure\u000afrom observed velocities assuming $\u005cOmega=1$, or as deduced from a redshift\u000asurvey of \u005ciras\u005c galaxies assuming that galaxies trace mass, are consistent\u000awith Gaussian initial fluctuations.\u000a

However, for both types of scenarios, agreement with the observed\u000atemperature can only be obtained if BARYON PAIRING IS PRESENT IN MOST, IF NOT\u000aALL, OF THE CORE OF THE STAR.\u000a  We also comment on the recent temperature estimates for PSR 0656+14 and PSR\u000a1055-52, which pertain to the same photon cooling era. We argue though that\u000aobservational evidence for the slow neutrino cooling model (the ``standard''\u000amodel) is in fact very dim and that the interpretation of the surface\u000atemperature of all neutron stars could be done with a reasonable theoretical a\u000apriori within the fast neutrino cooling scenarios only. In this case, Geminga,\u000aPSR 0656+14, and PSR 1055-52 all show evidence of baryon pairing down to their\u000avery centers. xxx----To be published in Ap.J. (June 10 isue).---xxx\u000a

V  Previous comparisons of optical and X-ray observations of clusters of\u000agalaxies have lead to the so-called ``$\u005cbeta$ - discrepancy'' that has\u000apersisted for the last decade. The standard hydrostatic-isothermal model for\u000aclusters predicts that the parameter $\u005cbeta_{spec} = \u005csigma_{r}^{2}/(kT/\u005cmu\u000am_{p})$, which describes the ratio of energy per unit mass in galaxies to that\u000ain the gas, should equal the parameter $\u005cbeta_{fit}$ (where $\u005crho_{gas}(r)\u000a\u005cpropto \u005crho_{gal}(r)^{\u005cbeta_{fit}}$) determined from the X-ray surface\u000abrightness distribution. The observations suggest an apparent discrepancy :\u000a$\u005cbeta_{spec} \u005csim 1.2$ (i.e., the galaxies are ``hotter'' than the gas) while\u000a$\u005cbeta_{fit} \u005csim 0.65$ (i.e., the gas is ``hotter'' and more extended than the\u000agalaxies). Here we show that the discrepancy is resolved when the actual\u000aobserved galaxy distribution in clusters is used, $\u005crho_{gal}(r) \u005cpropto\u000ar^{-2.4 \u005cpm 0.2}$, instead of the previously assumed steeper King\u000aapproximation, $\u005crho_{gal}(r) \u005cpropto r^{-3}$. Using a large sample of\u000aclusters, we find best-fit mean values of $\u005cbeta_{spec} = 0.94 \u005cpm 0.08$ and\u000a$\u005cbeta_{fit}^{corrected} = 1.25 \u005ctimes \u005cbeta_{fit} = 0.84 \u005cpm 0.10$. These\u000aresults resolve the $\u005cbeta$ - discrepancy and provide support for the\u000ahydrostatic cluster model.\u000a

V  We calculate the cosmological evolution of the 1-point probability\u000adistribution function (PDF), using an analytic approximation that combines\u000agravitational perturbation theory with the Edgeworth expansion of the PDF. Our\u000amethod applies directly to a smoothed mass density field or to the divergence\u000aof a smoothed peculiar velocity field, provided that rms fluctuations are small\u000acompared to unity on the smoothing scale, and that the primordial fluctuations\u000athat seed the growth of structure are Gaussian. We use this `Edgeworth\u000aapproximation' to compute the evolution of $<\u005cdelta|\u005cdelta|>$ and $<|delta|>$;\u000athese measures are similar to the skewness and kurtosis of the density field,\u000abut they are less sensitive to tails of the probability distribution, so they\u000amay be more accurately estimated from surveys of limited volume. We compare our\u000aanalytic calculations to cosmological N-body simulations in order to assess\u000atheir range of validity. When $\u005csigma \u005cll 1$, the numerical simulations and\u000aperturbation theory agree precisely, demonstrating that the N-body method can\u000ayield accurate results in the regime of weakly non-linear clustering. We show\u000aanalytically that `biased' galaxy formation preserves the relation $<\u005cdelta^3>\u000a\u005cpropto <\u005cdelta^2>^2$ predicted by second-order perturbation theory, provided\u000athat the galaxy density is a local function of the underlying mass density.\u000a

V  Observations from the first flight of the Medium Scale Anisotropy Measurement\u000a(MSAM) are analyzed to place limits on Gaussian fluctuations in the Cosmic\u000aMicrowave Background Radiation (CMBR). This instrument chops a 30\u005carcmin\u005c beam\u000ain a 3 position pattern with a throw of $\u005cpm40\u005carcmin$; the resulting data is\u000aanalyzed in statistically independent single and double difference datasets. We\u000aobserve in four spectral channels at 5.6, 9.0, 16.5, and 22.5~\u005cicm, allowing\u000athe separation of interstellar dust emission from CMBR fluctuations. The dust\u000acomponent is correlated with the \u005cIRAS\u005c 100~\u005cmicron\u005c map. The CMBR component\u000ahas two regions where the signature of an unresolved source is seen. Rejecting\u000athese two source regions, we obtain a detection of fluctuations which match\u000aCMBR in our spectral bands of $0.6 \u005ctimes 10^{-5} < \u005cDelta T/T < 2.2 \u005ctimes\u000a10^{-5}$ (90\u005c% CL interval) for total rms Gaussian fluctuations with\u000acorrelation angle 0\u005cfdg5, using the single difference demodulation. For the\u000adouble difference demodulation, the result is $1.1 \u005ctimes 10^{-5} < \u005cDelta T/T\u000a< 3.1 \u005ctimes 10^{-5}$ (90\u005c% CL interval) at a correlation angle of 0\u005cfdg3.\u000a

V  In almost any scenario for 'cosmological' gamma-ray bursts (and in many\u000amodels where they originate in our own Galaxy), the initial energy density is\u000aso large that the resulting relativistic plasma expands with $v\u005csim c$\u000aproducing a blast wave ahead of it and a reverse shock moving into the ejecta,\u000aas it ploughs into the external medium. We evaluate the radiation expected from\u000athese shocks,for both cosmological and galactic bursts, for various assumptions\u000aabout the strength of the magnetic field and the particle acceleration\u000amechanisms in the shocks. The spectra are evaluated over the whole range from\u000athe IR to $>$ GeV, and are compared with the variety of spectral behavior\u000areported by BATSE, and with the X-ray and optical constraints. For bursts of\u000aduration $\u005csimg 1\u005cs$ acceptable $\u005cgamma$-ray spectra and $L_x/L_\u005cgamma$ ratios\u000aare readily obtained for 'cosmological' models. Blast waves in galactic models\u000acan produce bursts of similar gamma-ray fluence and duration, but they violate\u000athe X-ray paucity constraint, except for the shorter bursts ($\u005csiml 1\u005cs$). We\u000adiscuss the prospects for using O/UV and X-ray observations to discriminate\u000aamong alternative models.\u000a

V  The abundance and internal characteristics of rich clusters of galaxies can\u000aprovide useful constraints on models of large--scale structure formation. This\u000aarticle will review some recent three dimensional, multi--fluid simulations of\u000acluster dynamics and discuss their impact on issues raised from optical and\u000aX-ray observations of clusters. In `bottom--up' formation scenarios (such as\u000athe ubiquitous cold dark matter model), galaxies form before rich clusters;\u000ahence, cluster formation is intimately linked to galaxy formation which, in\u000aturn, is tied to star formation. I will examine two issues which appear\u000arelatively insensitive to galaxy/star formation --- the baryon fraction in\u000aclusters and the connection between X--ray morphology and $\u005cOmega_o$ --- and\u000aend with a topic that is intimately linked to it --- dynamical biases in the\u000acluster galaxy population.\u000a

V  We investigate the effects of dynamical Comptonization on the emergent\u000aradiation spectrum produced by near critical accretion onto a neutron star. The\u000aflow dynamics and the transfer of radiation are self--consistently solved in\u000athe case of a spherically symmetric, ``cold'', pure scattering flow, including\u000ageneral relativity. A sequence of models, each characterized by the value of\u000athe total observed luminosity, was obtained assuming that the spectrum at the\u000astar surface is black body in shape. It is found that when the luminosity\u000aapproaches the Eddington limit dynamical effects become important shifting the\u000aspectrum to the blue and producing a power--law, high--energy tail. The\u000arelevance of these results in connection with the observed spectral properties\u000aof LMXBs, and of Cyg X--2 in particular, are discussed.\u000a

V  A generic outcome of theories with scalar-tensor coupling is the existence of\u000ainflationary attractors, either power-law or de Sitter. The fluctuations\u000aarising during this phase are Gaussian and their spectrum depends on the\u000awavenumber $k$ according to the power-law $k^{1/(1-p)}$, where $p$ is the\u000ainflationary power-law exponent. We investigate to which extent these\u000aproperties depend on the coupling function and on the potential. We find the\u000aclass of models in which viable attractors exist. Within this class, we find\u000athat the cosmic expansion and the scaling of the fluctuation spectrum are\u000aindependent of the coupling function. Further, the analytical solution of the\u000aFokker-Planck equation shows that the deviations from Gaussianity are\u000anegligible.\u000a

V  If gamma-ray bursters are at cosmological distances - as suggested by their\u000aisotropic distribution on the sky and by their number-intensity relation - then\u000athe burst profiles will be stretched in time, by an amount proportional to the\u000aredshift, 1 + $z$. We have tested data from the {\u005cit Compton} Gamma Ray\u000aObservatory's Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) for such time\u000adilation. Our measures of time scale are constructed to avoid selection effects\u000aarising from intensity differences by rescale all bursts to fiducial levels of\u000apeak intensity and noise bias. The three tests involved total count rate above\u000abackground, wavelet decomposition, and alignment of the highest peaks. In all\u000athree tests, the dim bursts are stretched by a factor of about two relative to\u000athe bright ones, over seven octaves of time scale. We calibrated the\u000ameasurements by dilating synthetic bursts that approximate the temporal\u000acharacteristics of bright BATSE bursts. Results are consistent with bursts of\u000aBATSE's peak-flux completeness limit being at cosmological distances\u000acorresponding to $z \u005csim 1$, and thus with independent cosmological\u000ainterpretations of the BATSE number-intensity relation.\u000a

V  We present here the Spatial Two--Point Correlation Function for a complete\u000asample of 67 X--ray selected Abell clusters of galaxies. We find a correlation\u000alength of $16.1\u005cpm3.4\u005cmpc$ with no significant clustering beyond\u000a$\u005csimeq40\u005cmpc$. This is the lowest uncorrected value for the correlation length\u000aever derived from the Abell catalogue of clusters. In addition, we have\u000ainvestigated the anisotropy of the correlation function between the radial and\u000atransverse directions. This can be characterised by the magnitude of pair--wise\u000acluster peculiar velocities such anisotropy predicts, which we find to be\u000a$\u005csimeq800{\u005crm km\u005c,s^{-1}}$ for our sample. Again, this is the lowest\u000auncorrected value ever seen for the Abell catalogue. We therefore, no longer\u000aneed to invoke high cluster peculiar velocities or line of sight clustering to\u000aunderstand the correlation function as derived from an Abell sample of\u000aclusters. Furthermore, our result is consistent with recently published\u000acorrelation functions computed from automated selections of optical and X--ray\u000aclusters. Therefore, we are now approaching a coherent picture for the form of\u000athe cluster spatial correlation function which will be used to place confident\u000aconstraints on theories of galaxy formation.\u000a

V  (shortened for babbage) We describe (1) a new test for dark matter and\u000aalternate theories of gravitation based on the relative geometries of the X-ray\u000aand optical surface brightness distributions and an assumed form for the\u000apotential of the optical light, (2) a technique to measure the shapes of the\u000atotal gravitating matter and dark matter of an ellipsoidal system which is\u000ainsensitive to the precise value of the temperature of the gas and to modest\u000atemperature gradients, and (3) a method to determine the ratio of dark mass to\u000astellar mass that is dependent on the functional forms for the visible star,\u000agas and dark matter distributions, but independent of the distance to the\u000agalaxy or the gas temperature. We apply these techniques to X-ray data from the\u000aROSAT Position Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC) of the optically-flattened\u000aelliptical galaxy NGC 720. The X-ray isophotes are significantly elongated,\u000a$\u005cepsilon = 0.20 - 0.30$ (90% confidence) for semi-major axis $a\u005csim\u000a100\u005carcsec$. The major axes of the optical and X-ray isophotes are misaligned\u000aby $\u005csim 30\u005cdeg \u005cpm 15\u005cdeg$ (90% confidence). We conclude that matter\u000adistributed like the optical light cannot produce the observed ellipticities of\u000athe X-ray isophotes independent of the gas pressure, the gas temperature, and\u000athe value of the stellar mass.\u000a

V  We report on the Lovers of Active Galaxies' (LAG) monitoring of the Seyfert 1\u000agalaxy Markarian 279 from January to June 1990. The source, which was in a very\u000abright state, gradually weakened after the first month of monitoring: the\u000aH-Alpha and H-Beta flux decreased by 20% and 35% respectively, and the\u000acontinuum under H-Alpha by 30%. The luminosity-weighted radius of the broad\u000aline region (BLR), as derived from the cross-correlation function, is of the\u000aorder of 10 light days. This result is very uncertain because the features in\u000athe light curves are very shallow, but it is unlikely that the radius of the\u000aBLR is more than 1 light month. The profile variations of H-Alpha confirm that\u000athe prevailing motions are not radial. The data of the present campaign and\u000athose obtained in previous years, when the source was in a much weaker state,\u000ashow that the red asymmetry of the Balmer lines correlates positively with the\u000abroad line flux. This new effect is briefly discussed.\u000a

V  A population of molecular clouds with a significantly greater scale height\u000athan that of Giant Molecular Clouds has been identified by examining maps of\u000athe latitude distribution of the $^{12}CO(1-0)$ emission in the first quadrant\u000aof the Galaxy. These clouds are found by identifying emission more than 2.6\u000atimes the scale-height away from the galactic midplane (centroid of CO\u000aemission) at the tangent points. Since the distance to the tangent points is\u000aknown, we know the height and the sizes of these clouds. They are smaller and\u000afainter than the GMCs and do not seem to be gravitationally bound. These clouds\u000ahave properties similar to the high latitude clouds in the solar neighborhood.\u000aAlthough they lie outside the molecular cloud layer, the high altitude clouds\u000aare well within the HI layer in the Galaxy and coincide with distinct peaks in\u000athe HI distribution. These clouds represent a galaxy wide population of small\u000amolecular clouds having a larger scale height. They may be clouds in transition\u000abetween molecular and atomic phases.\u000a

V  Velocity bias is a reduction of the velocity dispersion of tracer galaxies in\u000acomparison to the velocity dispersion of the underlying mass field. There are\u000atwo distinct forms of velocity bias. The single particle velocity reduction,\u000a$b_v(1)$, is the result of energy loss of a tracer population, and in\u000avirialized regions, such as galaxy clusters, is intimately associated with mass\u000asegregation which together lead to cluster mass underestimates. The pairwise\u000avelocity bias, $b_v(2)$, has an additional statistical reduction if the total\u000amass per galaxy rises with velocity dispersion of the virialized cluster.\u000aValues of the velocity bias are estimated from n-body simulations, finding\u000a$b_v(1)\u005csimeq 0.85\u005cpm0.1$ and $b_v(2)\u005csimeq 0.6\u005cpm0.2$. The value of $b_v(1)$\u000ais relatively secure and predicts that the virial radius of the cluster light\u000ais about 20\u005c% of the cluster mass, which can be tested with observations of\u000acluster mass profiles beyond the apparent virial radius. The value of $b_v(2)$\u000ais sensitive to the formation efficiency of galaxies over environments ranging\u000afrom voids to rich clusters, the latter of which are not yet well resolved in\u000asimulations. An $n=1$, $\u005cOmega=1$, COBE normalized CDM spectrum requires\u000a$b_v(2)\u005csimeq0.20(15\u005cmu K/Q)(\u005csigma_{12}/317 \u005ckms)$ which is well below the\u000ameasured range of $b_v(2)$. The pairwise velocities at 1 \u005chmpc\u005c allow\u000a$\u005cOmega=1$ for a galaxy clustering bias near unity if $b_v(2)\u005csimeq0.6$.\u000a

Inflation addresses the shortcomings of the\u000astandard cosmology and provides the ``initial data'' for structure formation. I\u000aconclude by addressing the implications of inflation for structure formation,\u000aevaluating the various cold dark matter models in the light of the recent\u000adetection of temperature anisotropies in the cosmic background radiation by\u000aCOBE. In the near term, the study of structure formation offers a powerful\u000aprobe of inflation, as well as specific inflationary models.\u000a

V  We re-evaluate the matrix element for the proton-proton reaction which is\u000aimportant for stellar-evolution calculations and for the solar-neutrino\u000aproblem. We self-consistently determine the effect of vacuum polarization on\u000athe matrix element by first correcting the low-energy scattering data to\u000aaccount for vacuum polarization. We then calculate the proton-proton wave\u000afunction by integrating the Schrodinger equation with vacuum polarization\u000aincluded. We use improved data for proton-proton scattering and for the\u000adeuteron wave function. We evaluate the uncertainties that are due to\u000aexperimental error and estimate those that are due to theoretical inadequacies.\u000aWe estimate the theoretical uncertainty by using six different deuteron\u000apotentials and five different proton-proton potentials. Vacuum polarization\u000adecreases the calculated value by $0.6_{-0.4}^{+0.1}$\u005c%. The complete result is\u000a$\u005cLambda^2=6.92\u005ctimes(1\u005cpm0.002^{+0.014}_{-0.009})$ where the first uncertainty\u000ais due to experimental errors and the second uncertainty is due to theoretical\u000auncertainties. Our value of $\u005cLambda^2$ is 2\u005c% smaller than the value obtained\u000ain 1969 by Bahcall and May. The improved calculations of the rate of the $pp$\u000areaction described here increase slightly the predicted event rates for the\u000achlorine and the Kamiokande solar-neutrino experiments.\u000a

This includes in particular the derivation\u000aof the functional Schr\u005c"odinger equation and a discussion of semiclassical time\u000aas well as the derivation of quantum gravitational correction terms to the\u000aSchr\u005c"odinger equation.

Emphasis is also put on the relevance of decoherence and\u000acorrelations in semiclassical gravity. The back reaction of non-gravitational\u000aquantum fields onto the semiclassical background and the emergence of a Berry\u000aconnection on superspace is also discussed in this framework.\u000a

V  The rapid time variability of gamma-ray bursts implies the sources are very\u000acompact, and the peak luminosities are so high that some matter must be ejected\u000aat ultra-relativistic speeds. The very large Lorentz factors of the bulk flow\u000aare also indicated by the very broad and hard spectra. It is natural to expect\u000athat when the relativistic ejecta interact with the interstellar matter a\u000astrong synchrotron radio emission is generated, as is the case with supernova\u000aremnants and radio galaxies. We estimate that the strongest gamma-ray bursts\u000amay be followed by radio transients with peak fluxes as high as 0.1 Jy. The\u000atime of peak radio emission depends on the distance scale; it is less than a\u000aminute if the bursts are in the galactic halo, and about a week if the bursts\u000aare at cosmological distances.\u000a

V  We present convenient formulae for the energy losses of energetic atomic\u000anuclei over the entire energy range relevant to the physics of cosmic rays.\u000aResults are applied to a leaky-box equation with a complete loss term. Thereby\u000awe derive the equilibrium spectrum of cosmic rays in various types of galaxies.\u000aWe emphasize a spectral break energy at 450 MeV independent of the matter\u000adensity, resulting from the transition from Coulomb and ionization losses to\u000apion production losses as the relevant cooling process for the cosmic ray\u000anuclei . We comment on the possible cosmic ray origin of the cosmic gamma ray\u000abackground.\u000a

V  The four observables associated with gravitational lensing of distant quasars\u000aby intervening galaxies: image splittings, relative amplifications, time\u000adelays, and optical depths, provide separate measures of the strength of the\u000agravitational constant $G$ at cosmological distances. These allow one, in\u000aprinciple, to factor out unknown lensing parameters to directly to probe the\u000avariation of $G$ over cosmological time. We estimate constraints on $\u005cdot{G}$\u000awhich may be derivable by this method both now and in the future. The limits\u000aone may obtain can compete or exceed other direct limits on $\u005cdot{G}$ today,\u000abut unfortunately extracting this information, is not independent of the effort\u000ato fix other cosmological parameters such as $H_0$ and $\u005cOmega_0$ from lensing\u000aobservations.\u000a

V  We present an exact solution of the anisotropies of cosmic background\u000aradiation (CBR) from a local collapse described by a spherical over-dense\u000aregion embedded in a flat universe, with the emphasis on the relationship\u000abetween the dipole $(\u005cDelta {\u005csf T}/{\u005csf T})_d$ and the quadrupole $(\u005cDelta\u000a{\u005csf T}/{\u005csf T})_q$ anisotropy. This result has been used to examine the\u000akinematic quadrupole correction $(\u005cDelta {\u005csf T}/{\u005csf T})_q=(\u005cDelta {\u005csf\u000aT}/{\u005csf T})_d^2/2$, which is usually applied to remove the contamination of the\u000aquadrupole produced by local density inhomogeneities when finding the cosmic\u000aamplitude of the quadrupole at the surface of last scattering. We have found\u000athat the quadrupole of local collapse origin cannot always be approximately\u000adescribed by the kinematic quadrupole. Our numerical result shows that the\u000adifference between the kinematic and local quadrupoles depends on the size and\u000amatter density in the peculiar field, and the position of the observer. For a\u000agiven dipole, the local quadrupole can be different from the kinematic\u000aquadrupole by a factor as large as 3. Therefore, the kinematic quadrupole\u000acorrection remains an uncertain factor in the determination of the amplitude of\u000aa cosmic quadrupole. Nevertheless, a preliminary analysis shows that this\u000auncertainty might not dramatically change the cosmological origin of the\u000aCOBE-DMR's quadrupole, unless a huge peculiar gravitational field is assumed.\u000a

V  ABSRACT: We review recent progress on testing the hypothesis of the existence\u000aof cosmic string perturbations in microwave background maps. Using an\u000aanalytical model for the string network we show that the predicted amplitude\u000aand spectrum of MBR fluctuations are consistent with the COBE data for a\u000areasonable value of the single free parameter of the string model (the mass per\u000aunit length of the string $\u005cmu$). To {\u005cit distinguish} the predictions of\u000acosmic strings from those of Gaussian models it is necessary to apply specific\u000a{\u005cit statistical tests} which are sensitive to non-random phases of the MBR\u000atemperature maps. We discuss two such statistical tests: First, the probability\u000adistribution and the moments of fluctuations ${{\u005cdelta T}\u005cover T}$ and second\u000athe corresponding statistical quantities for the {\u005cit gradient} of fluctuations\u000aalong a fixed direction. We show that the second statistic can detect cosmic\u000astring specific signatures on MBR temperature maps with resolution of a few\u000aarcminutes or smaller.\u000a

V  We consider chaotic inflation in the theories with the effective potentials\u000aphi^n and e^{\u005calpha\u005cphi}. In such theories inflationary domains containing\u000asufficiently large and homogeneous scalar field \u005cphi permanently produce new\u000ainflationary domains of a similar type. We show that under certain conditions\u000athis process of the self-reproduction of the Universe can be described by a\u000astationary distribution of probability, which means that the fraction of the\u000aphysical volume of the Universe in a state with given properties (with given\u000avalues of fields, with a given density of matter, etc.) does not depend on\u000atime, both at the stage of inflation and after it. This represents a strong\u000adeviation of inflationary cosmology from the standard Big Bang paradigm. We\u000acompare our approach with other approaches to quantum cosmology, and illustrate\u000asome of the general conclusions mentioned above with the results of a computer\u000asimulation of stochastic processes in the inflationary Universe.\u000a

V  Generalizing the original work by Hodges and Blumenthal, we outline a\u000aformalism which allows one, in principle, to reconstruct the potential of the\u000ainflaton field from knowledge of the tensor gravitational wave spectrum or the\u000ascalar density fluctuation spectrum, with special emphasis on the importance of\u000athe tensor spectrum. We provide some illustrative examples of such\u000areconstruction. We then discuss in some detail the question of whether one can\u000ause real observations to carry out this procedure. We conclude that in\u000apractice, a full reconstruction of the functional form of the potential will\u000anot be possible within the foreseeable future. However, with a knowledge of the\u000adark matter components, it should soon be possible to combine\u000aintermediate-scale data with measurements of large-scale cosmic microwave\u000abackground anisotropies to yield useful information regarding the potential.\u000a

V  We study gravitational lensing by clusters of galaxies in the context of the\u000ageneric class of unconventional gravity theories of the scalar--tensor type.\u000aFor positive energy scalar fields with any dynamics, the bending of light by a\u000aweakly gravitating system (galaxy or cluster) is always smaller than the\u000abending predicted by general relativity for the mass of visible and hitherto\u000aundetected matter (but excluding the scalar field energy). The same conclusion\u000aobtains within general relativity if a nonnegligible part of the mass in\u000aclusters is in coherent scalar fields, {\u005cit i.e.\u005c/} Higgs fields. Thus the\u000aobservational claim that clusters of galaxies deflect light much more strongly\u000athan would be expected from the observable matter contained by them, cannot be\u000ainterpreted in terms of some scalar-tensor unconventional gravity theory with\u000ano dark matter. If the observations eventually show that the matter\u000adistribution inferred via general relativity from the lensing is very much like\u000athat determined from the dynamics of test objects, then scalar--tensor\u000aunconventional gravity will be irrelevant for understanding the mass\u000adiscrepancy in clusters. However, even a single system in which the dynamically\u000adetermined mass significantly exceeds the lensing mass suggested by general\u000arelativity, would be very problematic for the dark matter picture, but would be\u000aentirely consistent with unconventional scalar--tensor gravity.\u000a

V  A unified theory of all forces should be nonsingular. In such a unified\u000atheory, Einstein's general relativity will be a very low curvature effective\u000atheory. At larger curvatures, new terms will become important. The question\u000athen arises as to whether it is possible to construct an effective action for\u000agravity which leads to a nonsingular theory. In this work, we construct an\u000aeffective action for gravity in which all homogenerous and isotropic solutions\u000aare nonsingular. In particular, there is neither a big bang nor a big crunch.\u000aPreliminary work indicates that our construction provides a theory in which\u000aanisotropies decrease at large curvatures, and in which the inside of a black\u000ahole is singularity free.\u000a

V  We investigate models of `intermediate' inflation, where the scale factor\u000a$a(t)$ grows as $a(t) = \u005cexp (A t^f)$, $0 < f < 1$, $A$ constant. These\u000asolutions arise as exact analytic solutions for a given class of potentials for\u000athe inflaton $\u005cphi$. For a simpler class of potentials falling off as a power\u000aof $\u005cphi$ they arise as slow-roll solutions, and in particular they include,\u000afor $f = 2/3$, the class of potentials which give the Harrison--Zel'dovich\u000aspectrum. The perturbation spectral index $n$ can be greater than unity on\u000aastrophysical scales. It is also possible to generate substantial gravitational\u000awaves while keeping the scalar spectrum close to scale-invariance; this latter\u000apossibility performs well when confronted with most observational data.\u000a

V  The color-magnitude diagram of $ \u005csim 3 \u005ctimes 10^5 $ stars obtained for\u000aBaade's Window towards the Galactic bulge with the OGLE project reveals a\u000asurprisingly narrow main sequence due to galactic disk stars at a distance of\u000a$d \u005csim 2 $ kpc, i.e. at the location of the Sagittarius spiral arm. A more\u000acareful analysis indicates there is an excess in the number of disk stars by a\u000afactor $\u005csim 2$ between us and $d \u005csim 2.5$ kpc and a rapid drop by a factor\u000a$\u005csim 10$ beyond that distance. It is unlikely that the observed structure is\u000aan artifact of the interstellar extinction, but careful determination of the\u000aextinction is needed before the structure is firmly established. The narrow\u000amain sequence extends down to stars as faint as $M_{_V} \u005capprox 7$, i.e. it is\u000acomposed of old stars. This is not expected in a conventional disk model, or in\u000aa conventional model of a spiral structure. However, a strong concentration of\u000aold stars towards spiral arms has been noticed in some other galaxies, like M51\u000a(Rix \u005c& Rieke 1993), with the near infrared surface photometry. We have also\u000afound that the relative distribution of red clump and red giant stars in the\u000aGalactic bulge implies that there is a relatively young stellar population\u000apresent there.\u000a

V  We have obtained surface photometry in U, B, R and I for a complete optically\u000aselected sample of 45 early-type spiral galaxies, to investigate the colors and\u000acolor gradients of spiral bulges. Color profiles in U-R, B-R, U-B and R-I have\u000abeen determined in wedges opening on the minor axes. Based on several criteria,\u000awe have defined a subsample of 18 objects whose colors are largely unaffected\u000aby dust. We find that the colors of bulges are predominantly bluer than those\u000aof ellipticals. This result holds even when bulges are compared to ellipticals\u000aof the same luminosity, and indicates that bulges are younger and/or more\u000ametal-poor than elliptical galaxies. Most bulges do not reach solar\u000ametallicities. Bulges show predominantly negative color gradients (bluer\u000aoutward) that increases with bulge luminosity. The similarity with ellipticals\u000asuggests that the formation of the disk did not affect the stellar populations\u000aof the bulge in a major way.\u000a

V  This series of papers comprises a systematic exploration of the hypothesis\u000athat the far ultraviolet radiation from star clusters and elliptical galaxies\u000aoriginates from extremely hot horizontal-branch (HB) stars and their post-HB\u000aprogeny. This first paper presents an extensive grid of calculations of stellar\u000amodels from the Zero Age Horizontal Branch through to a point late in post-HB\u000aevolution or a point on the white dwarf cooling track. We use the term `Extreme\u000aHorizontal Branch' (EHB) to refer to HB sequences of constant mass that do not\u000areach the thermally-pulsing stage on the AGB. These models evolve after core\u000ahelium exhaustion\u000a

V  Comparison of theobservedanisotropy with that predicted iadiabaticDM models\u000asuggest that much of thserved signal may be due to long wavelenh gravitational\u000awaves. In inflationary models this requires the generation of tensor\u000afluctuations to be at least comparable to scalar density fltuations. This i is\u000afeasible, but depends sensitively on the inflaton potential. Alternatively,\u000aisocurvature quantum fluctuations in an axion-like field could produce a\u000aquadrupole anisotropy proportional to the gravitational wave anisotropy,k\u000aindependent of the inflaton potential. These could also produce large scale\u000astructure with more power on larger scales than their adiabatic counterparts.\u000a

V  Exact and explicit string solutions in de Sitter spacetime are found. (Here,\u000athe string equations reduce to a sinh-Gordon model). A new feature without flat\u000aspacetime analogy appears: starting with a single world-sheet, several (here\u000atwo) strings emerge. One string is stable and the other (unstable) grows as the\u000auniverse grows. Their invariant size and energy either grow as the expansion\u000afactor or tend to constant. Moreover, strings can expand (contract) for large\u000a(small) universe radius with a different rate than the universe.\u000a

V  Pseudo-Goldstone bosons couple with photons through a P and T violating\u000ainteraction of the form ${\u005ccal {L_I}}=g_{a\u005cgamma \u005cgamma}~ a F\u005ctilde F$. Strong\u000amagnetic fields in rotating compact stars induce a non-zero ${\u005cvec E}\u005ccdot{\u005cvec\u000aB}$ outside the stellar surface which acts as a source for the pseudo-scalar\u000afield. Pulsar signals propagating through this pseudo-scalar `hair' suffer a\u000adifferential time lag between the left and the right circularly polarised modes\u000abecause of the P and T violating pseudoscalar boson-photon interaction.\u000aDetermination of this time lag upto a microsecond accuracy can lead to a\u000ameasurment of (or rule out) pseudo-Goldstone boson-photon coupling upto $g_{a\u000a\u005cgamma \u005cgamma}\u005cleq 4.6 \u005ctimes 10^{-9}~GeV^{-1}$.\u000a

V  We calculate the tension $\u005csigma$ of the interface between the confined and\u000adeconfined phases by the histogram method in SU(3) lattice gauge theory for\u000atemporal extents of 4 and 6 using the recent high-statistics data by QCDPAX\u000acollaboration. The results are $\u005csigma/T_c^3 = 0.0292(22)$ and 0.0218(33) for\u000a$N_t=4$ and 6, respectively. The ratio $\u005csigma/T_c^3$ shows a scaling violation\u000asimilar to that already observed for the latent heat $\u005clatent$. However, we\u000afind that the physically interesting dimensionless combinations\u000a$(\u005csigma^{3}/\u005clatent^2 T)^{1/2}$ and $\u005csigma T/ \u005clatent$ scale within the\u000astatistical errors.\u000a

V  We evaluate the large scale polarization of the cosmic microwave background\u000ainduced, via Thomson scattering prior to decoupling, by nearly scale-invariant\u000aspectra of scalar and tensor metric perturbations, such as those predicted by\u000amost inflationary models of the early Universe. We solve the radiative transfer\u000aequation for the polarized photon distribution function analytically, for\u000awavelengths of order or larger than the horizon size at decoupling, assuming no\u000areionization. The induced polarization is proportional to the redshift induced\u000aby the perturbations at decoupling and to the duration of the decoupling\u000atransition. Normalizing the spectra to the quadrupole anisotropy measured by\u000athe COBE satellite, the expected degree of linear polarization is $P\u005clsim\u000a10^{-7}$, more than two orders of magnitude smaller than current bounds. The\u000adependence of $P$ with the tilt in the spectrum away from scale invariance is\u000atoo weak to be of observational relevance or to provide a sensitive\u000adiscrimination between scalar and tensor fluctuations. The variation of $P$\u000awith the angular scale is significant.\u000a

V  An exact numerical calculation of neutrino emissivity of two and three\u000aflavour quark matter have been carried out. We find that the neutrino\u000aemissivity obtained from the Iwamoto formula is in qualitative agreement with\u000aour calculation for two flavour quark matter. For three flavour case, on the\u000aother hand we find that the Iwamoto formula overestimates the numerical values\u000aby $\u005csim$2 orders of magnitude or more for d decay and agrees with the s decay\u000aresults within a factor of 3-4. The dependence of the emissivity on\u000atemperature, strong coupling constant and baryon density is also quite\u000adifferent from the Iwamoto formula.\u000a

V  If the dark matter in galactic halos is made up of compact, macroscopic\u000aobjects (MO), such as black holes with $M_\u005cMO >>M_{stars}$, gravitational\u000ascattering will lead to kinematic heating of the stars. Observational\u000aconstraints on the amount of heating in the disk of the Milky Way put upper\u000alimits on $M_\u005cMO \u005cltorder 10^{6.3}\u005cmsun $. We find limits that are three orders\u000aof magnitude more stringent by examining the heating limits in low mass stellar\u000asystems, where higher densities of dark matter and lower relative velocities\u000adisperse the stars in less than a billion years. Specifically, the structure\u000aand kinematics of the Local Group member GR8 yield a limit of $M_\u005cMO \u005cltorder\u000a6\u005ctimes 10^{3}\u005cmsun$. If the properties of the dark matter are universal these\u000aresults preclude the dominance of dark matter constituents in the\u000acosmologically interesting mass range $\u005csim 10^6\u005cmsun$ and limit them to $M_\u005cMO\u000a\u005cltorder 10^{3.7}\u005cmsun$. These results also rule out massive compact halo\u000aobjects as significant contributors to the kinematic heating of the Galactic\u000adisk.\u000a

V  Using a set of $\u005cpppm$ simulation which accurately treats the density\u000aevolution of two components of dark matter, we study the evolution of clusters\u000ain the Cold + Hot dark matter (CHDM) model. The mass function, the velocity\u000adispersion function and the temperature function of clusters are calculated for\u000afour different epochs of $z\u005cle 0.5$. We also use the simulation data to test\u000athe Press-Schechter expression of the halo abundance as a function of the\u000avelocity dispersion $\u005csigma_v$. The model predictions are in good agreement\u000awith the observational data of local cluster abundances ($z=0$). We also\u000atentatively compare the model with the Gunn and his collaborators' observation\u000aof rich clusters at $z\u005capprox 0.8$ and with the x-ray luminous clusters at\u000a$z\u005capprox 0.5$ of the {\u005cit Einstein} Extended Medium Sensitivity Survey. The\u000aimportant feature of the model is the rapid formation of clusters in the near\u000apast: the abundances of clusters of $\u005csigma_v\u005cge 700\u005ckms$ and of $\u005csigma_v\u005cge\u000a1200 \u005ckms$ at $z=0.5$ are only 1/4 and 1/10 respectively of the present values\u000a($z=0$). Ongoing ROSAT and AXAF surveys of distant clusters will provide\u000asensitive tests to the model. The abundance of clusters at $z\u005capprox 0.5$ would\u000aalso be a good discriminator between the CHDM model and a low-density flat CDM\u000amodel both of which show very similar clustering properties at $z=0$.\u000a

We argue that the large-scale gradients observed in the Lick\u000acatalogue are dominated by real clustering and therefore they should not be\u000asubtracted prior to the estimation of the 2-p correlation function. We find\u000athat if no such correction is introduced the galaxy correlations are perfectly\u000aconsistent with the those found in the APM survey. Thus, the long standing\u000adiscrepancy between the Lick and APM angular correlations is lifted.\u000a

V  The clustering in redshift space is studied here to first order within the\u000aframework of gravitational instability. The distortion introduced by the\u000apeculiar velocities of galaxies results in anisotropy in the galaxy\u000adistribution and mode-mode coupling when analyzed in Fourier space. An exact\u000alinear calculation of the full covariance matrix in both the real and Fourier\u000aspace is presented here. The explicit dependence on $\u005cOmeg$ and the biasing\u000aparameter is calculated and its potential use as a probe of these parameters is\u000aanalyzed. It is shown that Kaiser's formalism can be applied only to a data set\u000athat subtends a small solid angle on the sky, and therefore cannot be used in\u000athe case of all sky surveys. The covariance matrix in the real space is\u000acalculated explicitly for {\u005cit CDM} model, where the behavior along and\u000aperpendicular to the line of sight is shown.\u000a

V  We consider the hot spots in FR-II galaxies as sites of first order Fermi\u000aacceleration of protons to the highest energies observed in cosmic rays. We\u000aestimate the attainable maximum energy in the hot spot region allowed by the\u000acanonical physical conditions, which are found from radio-to-optical\u000aobservations (Meisenheimer et al. 1989, A&A). We calculate observable the\u000aproton flux and spectrum from this sources, using all knowledge about source\u000adistibution (Peacock 1985, MNRAS) and particle transport in the microwave\u000abackground (Berezinsky and Grigor'eva 1988, A&A).

V  We propose a set of statistics $S_q$ for detecting non-gaussianity in CMBR\u000aanisotropy data sets. These statistics are both simple and, according to\u000acalculations over a space of linear combinations of three-point functions,\u000anearly optimal at detecting certain types of non-gaussian features. We apply\u000a$S_3$ to the UCSB SP91 experiment and find that the mean of the four frequency\u000achannels is by this criterion strongly non-gaussian. Such an observation would\u000abe highly unlikely in a gaussian theory with a small coherence angle, such as\u000astandard ($n=1$, $\u005cOmega_b = .05$, $h = .5$) inflation. We cannot conclude that\u000athe non-gaussianity is cosmological in origin, but if we assume it due instead\u000ato foreground contamination or instrumental effects, and remove the points\u000awhich are clearly responsible for the non-gaussian behavior, the rms of the\u000aremaining fluctuations is too small for consistency with standard inflation.\u000aFurther data are needed before definitive conclusions may be drawn.

V  We consider the inner regions of accretion disks surrounding black holes and\u000aneutron stars and investigate the nonlinear time dependent evolution of\u000athermal-viscous instabilities. The viscous stress is assumed to be proportional\u000ato the gas pressure with the viscosity parameter formulated as $\u005calpha\u000a=\u005cmin[\u005calpha_0 (h/r)^n, \u005calpha_{\u005cmax}]$, where $h$ is the local scale height,\u000a$r$ is the distance from the central compact object, and $n$, $\u005calpha_0$ and\u000a$\u005calpha_{\u005cmax}$ are constants. It is found that the disk is unstable for\u000a$\u005calpha$ sufficiently sensitive to $h$ ($n \u005cgapprox 1.2$). The instabilities\u000aare globally coherent in the entire unstable region of the disk and, depending\u000aon the viscosity parameters, the time variability of the mass accretion rates\u000aare manifested as periodic or quasi-periodic oscillations. We show that, the\u000alow frequency ($\u005csim 0.04$~Hz) quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) discovered\u000arecently in some of the black hole candidates (Cyg~X-1 and GRO~J0422+32) and a\u000alow mass X-ray binary (Rapid Burster MXB~1730--335) may be explicable by the\u000athermal-viscous instabilities in accretion disks. The observations of QPOs\u000aplace constraints on the viscosity parameters and suggest that $(n,\u005calpha_0)$\u000a$\u005csim (1.6,30)$ for the Rapid Burster with a $1.4\u005c,\u005cmsun$ neutron star. In the\u000acase of black hole candidates, the dependence of $\u005calpha$ on $h/r$ is less\u000asteep corresponding to $n \u005csim 1.2-1.3$ for black holes less than $10\u005c,\u005cmsun$.\u000a

V  There have been several recent suggestions that the Milky Way has rotating\u000abar-like features based on HI and star count data. In this paper, I show that\u000asuch features cause distinctive stellar kinematic signatures near OLR and ILR.\u000aThe effects of these resonances may be observable far from the peak density of\u000athe pattern and relatively nearby the solar position. The details of the\u000akinematic signatures depend on the evolutionary history of the `bar' and\u000atherefore velocity data, both systemic and velocity dispersion, may be used to\u000aprobe the evolutionary history as well as the present state of the Galaxy.\u000aKinematic models for a variety of simple scenarios are presented. Models with\u000aevolving pattern speeds show significantly stronger dispersion signatures than\u000athose with static pattern speeds, suggesting that useful observational\u000aconstraints are possible. The models are applied to the proposed rotating\u000aspheroid and bar models; we find: 1) none of these models chosen to represent\u000athe proposed large-scale rotating spheroid are consistent with the stellar\u000akinematics; and 2) a Galactic bar with semimajor axis of $3\u005ckpc$ will cause a\u000alarge increase in velocity dispersion in the vicinity of OLR ($\u005csim5\u005ckpc$) with\u000alittle change in the net radial motion and such a signature is suggested by\u000aK-giant velocity data. Potential future observations and analyses are\u000adiscussed.\u000a

V  Relativistic blast wave models predict the spectrum of the emitted\u000asynchrotron radiation. The electrons in the shocked region are heated to a Wien\u000adistribution whose ``temperature'' is $1/3$ of the mean electron energy. This\u000aenergy scale determines a characteristic (break) frequency of synchrotron\u000aradiation. At much lower frequencies a spectrum $F_nu \u005cpropto \u005cnu^{1/3}$ is\u000apredicted independently of details of the emitting region. This is consistent\u000awith the observed soft X-ray spectra of GRB. It implies low visible and radio\u000aintensities, unless there are collective emission processes.\u000a

V  We address the possibility of bounding the spectral index $n$ of primordial\u000adensity fluctuations, using both the cosmic microwave background (cmb)\u000aanisotropy and data on galaxies and clusters. Each piece of galaxy and cluster\u000adata is reduced to a value of $\u005csigma(R)$ (the linearly evolved {\u005cem rms}\u000adensity contrast with top hat smoothing on scale $R$) which allows data on\u000adifferent scales to be readily compared. As a preliminary application, we\u000anormalise the spectrum using the ten degree variance of the COBE data, and then\u000acompare the prediction with a limited sample of low energy data, for the MDM\u000amodel with various values of $n$, $\u005cOmega_\u005cnu$ and $h$. With $h=.5$, the data\u000aconstrain the spectral index to the range $0.7\u005clsim n \u005clsim 1.2$. If\u000agravitational waves contribute to the cmb anisotropy with relative strength\u000a$R=6(1-n)$ (as in some models of inflation), the lower limit on $n$ is\u000aincreased to about $0.85$. The uncertainty in $h$ widens this band by about\u000a$0.1$ at either end.\u000a

V  There are strong indications from recent papers (e.g. Worthey et al. 1992)\u000athat the abundance ratio of Mg/Fe, and consequently also O/Fe in giant\u000aelliptical galaxies is not solar. The line strengths of two Fe lines at 5270\u000aand 5335 A are weaker than one expects from the strength of the Mg b line if\u000a[Mg/Fe] = 0. We have synthesized absorption line indices to derive the Mg and\u000aFe abundances of these galaxies. For these models we have calculated new\u000aevolutionary tracks of high metallicity stars with a range of Mg/Fe abundances.\u000aThis is the first time that such tracks have been generated. Integrating along\u000aisochrones to synthesize metal line strengths we find that for a typical bright\u000agiant elliptical [Mg/Fe] has to be between +0.3 and +0.7. We show that this\u000aresult is independent of other parameters such as age, total metal content and\u000amixing length parameter. The total metal content is super-solar, but the iron\u000ametallicity of elliptical galaxies not necessarily has to be larger than solar.\u000aFor the formation of elliptical galaxies our result on the Mg and Fe abundances\u000ahas the implication that most of the enrichment of the gas has to come from SNe\u000aII, which have more massive progenitors and as such produce relatively more O\u000aand Mg than Fe. It means that most of the stars have to be formed within a\u000aperiod of $3 \u005ctimes 10^8$ years, so that there can only be one major collapse\u000aphase of the galaxy.\u000a

These data are used to establish whether K-band ($2.2\u005cmu$)\u000aimages of spiral galaxies provide reliable maps of stellar surface mass density\u000afeatures such as massive spiral arms or bars. The main distorting agents in the\u000amapping at shorter wavelengths are dust extinction and luminous young stars.\u000aFrom modeling the color changes across the main dust lanes in M51, we find that\u000athe K-band flux is attenuated by only $\u005cltorder 10\u005c%$ even in the dust lanes.\u000aFrom monitoring the gravity-sensitive CO$(2.3\u005cmu )$ index across the spiral\u000aarms we find that young, red supergiants do not distort significantly the\u000aK-band image except in one small patch. On this basis, {\u005cit we conclude that K\u000aband images do trace the massive disk star population}. In M51 we find the\u000asurface mass density contrast (arm/inter-arm) to range from 1.8 to 3,\u000acomparable to results from N-body simulations of the galaxy's tidal encounter\u000awith NGC~5195.

Analytical expansions are given for the matter flow\u000anear the bow shock stagnation point. Numerical solutions are also obtained, by\u000ausing a revised Runge-Kutta method. This numerical method results to be\u000acomputationally stable and fast. When two winds interact, axisymmetric bow\u000ashocks are expected to form only if both winds are spherically symmetric. But\u000astellar winds often present strong anisotropies: for all these cases a\u000anon-axisymmetric model of bow shock is required.\u000a

V  The color-magnitude diagrams of $\u005csim 5\u005ctimes 10^5$ stars obtained for 13\u000afields towards the Galactic bulge with the OGLE project reveal a well-defined\u000apopulation of bulge red clump stars. We find that the distributions of the\u000aextinction-adjusted apparent magnitudes of the red clump stars in fields lying\u000aat $l=\u005cpm5\u005cdeg$ in galactic longitude differ by $0.37\u005cpm0.025\u005c;mag$. Assuming\u000athat the intrinsic luminosity distribution of the red clump stars is the same\u000aon both sides of the Galactic center, this implies that the distances to the\u000ared clump stars in the two fields differ by a factor of $1.185\u005cpm0.015$. A\u000aplausible explanation of the observed difference in the luminosity distribution\u000ais that the Galactic bulge is a triaxial structure, or bar, which is inclined\u000ato the line of sight by no more than $45\u005cdeg$, with the part of the bar at the\u000apositive galactic longitude being closer to us. This agrees rather well with\u000aother studies indicating the presence of the bar in the center of the Galaxy.\u000aColor-magnitude diagram data are accessible over the computer network with\u000aanonymous {\u005ctt ftp}.\u000a

V  Curve of growth analysis, applied to the Lyman series absorption ratios\u000adeduced in our previous paper, yields a measurement of the logarithmic slope of\u000adistribution of \u005cLya\u005c clouds in column density $N$. The observed exponential\u000adistribution of the clouds' equivalent widths $W$ is then shown to require a\u000abroad distribution of velocity parameters $b$, extending up to 80 km s$^{-1}$.\u000aWe show how the exponential itself emerges in a natural way. An absolute\u000anormalization for the differential distribution of cloud numbers in $z$, $N$,\u000aand $b$ is obtained. By detailed analysis of absorption fluctuations along the\u000aline of sight we are able to put upper limits on the cloud-cloud correlation\u000afunction $\u005cxi$ on several megaparsec length scales. We show that observed $b$\u000avalues, if thermal, are incompatible, in several different ways, with the\u000ahypothesis of equilibrium heating and ionization by a background UV flux.\u000aEither a significant component of $b$ is due to bulk motion (which we argue\u000aagainst on several grounds), or else the clouds are out of equilibrium, and\u000ahotter than is implied by their ionization state, a situation which could be\u000aindicative of recent adiabatic collapse.\u000a

V  A self-consistent model for binary evolution devised by Gingold \u005c& Monaghan\u000a(1980) is used to show that two distinctly different types of behaviour are\u000apossible for close eccentric binaries. The model is based on a linear adiabatic\u000anormal mode analysis of the problem, which allows detailed examination of the\u000atransfer of energy from the orbit to the tides. We show that for most binaries,\u000aenergy is exchanged quasi-periodically, with the system regulating itself so\u000athat the maximum tidal energy always remains small, and no circularization\u000atakes place. In contrast, for a range of eccentricities and periastron\u000aseparations, {\u005cit chaotic} behaviour prevails, with the eccentricity following\u000aa random walk and with the energy transferred to the tides during a single\u000aperiastron passage being up to an order of magnitude larger than that\u000atransferred during the initial periastron passage.\u000a  These results have important consequences for the study of tidal capture\u000abinaries. The standard model (see, for example, McMillan, McDermott \u005c& Taam\u000a1987) assumes that the energy transferred to the tides during a periastron\u000aencounter is independent of the oscillatory state of the stars, and that the\u000aamount of tidal energy present at any time can be calculated using a formula\u000awhich (accurately) gives the amount deposited after the first encounter (Press\u000a\u005c& Teukolsky 1977). The calculations presented here show that a self-consistent\u000atreatment is necessary in order to study the dynamical evolution of tidal\u000acapture binaries. We conclude that the tidal capture process would not be\u000apossible were it not for the existence of chaotic behaviour.\u000a

V  We show that the spatial correlation function of a flux-limited sample of\u000aX-ray selected clusters of galaxies will exhibit a correlation scale that is\u000asmaller than the correlation scale of a volume-limited, richness-limited sample\u000aof comparable apparent spatial density. The flux-limited sample contains\u000aclusters of different richnesses at different distances: poor groups are found\u000anearby and rich clusters at greater distances. Since the cluster correlation\u000astrength is known to increase with richness, the flux-limited sample averages\u000aover the correlations of poor and rich clusters. On the other hand, a\u000avolume-limited, richness-limited sample has a minimum richness threshold, and a\u000aconstant mixture of richnesses with redshift. Using the observed correlation\u000ascale for rich ($R\u005cge 1$) clusters, $r_o (R\u005cge 1) = 21\u005cpm 2 h^{-1}$Mpc that was\u000adetermined from previous volume-limited studies, we derive for the ROSAT\u000aflux-limited X-ray cluster sample $r_o({\u005crm flux}{\u005crm -}{\u005crm limited}) \u005capprox\u000a14h^{-1}$Mpc, in agreement with the recently observed value of $13.7\u005cpm 2.3\u000ah^{-1}$Mpc.\u000a

V  We propose that the prevalence of bipolarity in Young Stellar Objects is due\u000ato the fine tuning that is required for spherical accretion of an ambient\u000amedium onto a central node.It is shown that there are two steady modes that are\u000amore likely than radial accretion, each of which is associated with a\u000ahyperbolic central point in the meridional stream lines, and consequently with\u000aeither an equatorial inflow and an axial ejection or vice versa. In each case\u000athe stream lines pass through a thick accretion torus, which is better thought\u000aof as a standing pressure wave rather than as a relatively inert Keplerian\u000astructure.We base our arguments on a simple analytic example,which is topologi\u000acally generic,wherein each bipolarmode is created by the rebound of accreting\u000amatter under the action of the thermal,magnetic,turbulent and centrifugal\u000apressures created in the flow. In both bipolar modes the presence of non-zero\u000aangular momentum implies axial regions wherein the pressure is first reduced\u000abelow the value at infinity and then becomes negative, where the solution fails\u000abecause rotating material can not enter this region without suction.The model\u000athus has empty stems where the activity of the central source must dominate.So\u000athe basic engine of the bipolar flow discussed here is simply the rebound of\u000afreely falling material from a thick pressure disc into an axial low pressure\u000aregion.The low mass,high velocity outflow must be produced in this region by an\u000aadditional mechanism. This is reminiscent of the cored apple structure observed\u000arecently in the very young bipolar source VLA 1623.\u000a

Although remarkably robust, \u005cSPH\u005c\u000amust be used with care if the results are to be meaningful since the accuracy\u000aof \u005cSPH\u005c is sensitive to the arrangement of the particles and the form of the\u000asmoothing kernel. In particular, the initial conditions for any \u005cSPH\u005c\u000asimulation must consist of particles in dynamic equilibrium. We describe some\u000aof the numerical difficulties that may be encountered when using \u005cSPH, and how\u000athese may be overcome.

V  It has been shown that the large--scale correlation functions of the density\u000afield (and velocity divergence field) follow a specific hierarchy in the\u000aquasilinear regime and for Gaussian initial conditions (Bernardeau 1992). The\u000aexact relationships between the cumulants of the probability distribution\u000afunctions (the so-called $S_p$ parameters) are however sensitive to the\u000asmoothing window function applied to the fields. In this paper, I present a\u000amethod to derive the whole series of the $S_p$ parameters when the density\u000afield is smoothed with a top--hat window function. The results are valid for\u000aany power spectrum and any cosmological parameters. Similar calculations are\u000apresented for the velocity divergence field.\u000a  The resulting shapes of the one--point probability distribution functions of\u000athe cosmic density and the velocity divergence fields are given as a function\u000aof the power spectrum and $\u005cOmega$. Simple analytical fits are proposed when\u000athe index of the power spectrum is -1. Comparisons with numerical simulations\u000aprove these analytical results to be extremely accurate.\u000a

V  It is believed that most quasars and galaxies present two common features:\u000athe presence in their core of a supermassive object, and the experience of one\u000aor more encounters with other galaxies. In this scenario, it is likely that a\u000asubstantial fraction of active galactic nuclei harbour a supermassive binary,\u000afueled by an accretion disk. These binaries would certainly be among the\u000astrongest sources of sinusoidal gravitational waves. We investigate their\u000aevolution considering, simultaneously, the accretion of the black hole's masses\u000afrom the disk, and the gravitational waves emitted during the orbital motion.\u000aWe also consider other astrophysical scenarios involving a coalescing binary\u000awith non constant masses.\u000a

V  We derive lithium abundances in 53 T Tauri stars (TTS), concentrating on\u000aweak-line TTS. Our study gives the following results: 1)At luminosities $\u005cge\u000a0.9 L\u005csun$ the Li abundances are remarkably uniform, with a mean value,\u000alog~N(Li)=3.1, equal to the "cosmic" lithium abundance. 2)Significant Li\u000adepletion appears below 0.5~L$\u005csun$ in the mass range 0.9-0.2 M$\u005csun$ and\u000aincreases towards lower luminosities. At the lower mass end (0.4-0.2 M$\u005csun$),\u000athe observed luminosity of the Li burning turning point is about a factor 4\u000ahigher than predicted by the models. At masses 1.2-1.0 M$\u005csun$ the observations\u000aimply less PMS Li burning than theoretically expected. Moreover we show that:\u000a1)Low Li abundances appear only among stars with low $v\u005csin{i}$. Fast rotators\u000awith masses around 0.8~M$\u005csun$ do not show evidence for strong Li depletion\u000atowards lower luminosities as slow rotators do. 2)In a sample restricted to\u000aonly K5-K7 stars we find that the angular momentum spread before Li burning\u000abegins is larger than a factor 10. Lithium depletion associated to angular\u000amomentum loss during PMS evolution is not required to explain the observed\u000aabundances. The efficiency of PMS Li burning in the mass range 0.9-0.7~M$\u005csun$\u000ais reduced in the presence of rapid rotation.\u000a

We use one-dimensional operator-split finite-difference schemes\u000afor hydrodynamics with a von Neumann artificial viscosity. An internal-energy\u000ascheme converges to demonstrably wrong solutions. We associate this failure\u000awith the presence of discontinuities in the limiting solution. Our extension of\u000athe Lax-Wendroff theorem guarantees that certain conservative, operator-split\u000aschemes converge to the correct continuum solution. For such a total-energy\u000ascheme applied to the formation of a single shock, convergence of a Cauchy\u000aerror approaches the expected rate slowly. We relate this slowness to the\u000aeffect of varying diffusion, due to varying linear artificial-viscous length,\u000aon small-amplitude waves. In an appendix we discuss the scaling of\u000ashock-transition regions with viscous lengths, and exhibit several difficulties\u000afor attempts to make extrapolations.\u000a

V  A closed set of equations for the evolution of linear perturbations of\u000ahomogeneous, isotropic cosmological models can be obtained in various ways. The\u000asimplest approach is to assume a macroscopic equation of state, e.g.\u005c that of a\u000aperfect fluid. For a more refined description of the early universe, a\u000amicroscopic treatment is required. The purpose of this paper is to compare the\u000aapproach based on classical kinetic theory to the more recent\u000athermal-field-theory approach. It is shown that in the high-temperature limit\u000athe latter describes cosmological perturbations supported by collisionless,\u000amassless matter, wherein it is equivalent to the kinetic theory approach. The\u000adependence of the perturbations in a system of a collisionless gas and a\u000aperfect fluid on the initial data is discussed in some detail. All singular and\u000aregular solutions are found analytically.\u000a

V  Recently, Madsen has argued that relativistic decays of massive neutrinos\u000ainto lighter fermions and bosons may lead, via thermalization, to the formation\u000aof a Bose condensate. If correct, this could generate mixed hot and cold dark\u000amatter, with important consequences for structure formation.\u000a  From a detailed study of such decays, we arrive at substantially different\u000aconclusions; for a wide range of masses and decay times, we find that\u000astimulated emission of bosons dominates the decay. This phenomenon can best be\u000adescribed as a neutrino laser, pumped by the QCD phase transition. We discuss\u000athe implications for structure formation and the dark-matter problem.\u000a

V  In a recent paper Loveday et al. (1992) have presented new results on the\u000aluminosity function for a sample of galaxies with $b_J \u005cle 17.15$. After having\u000amorphologically classified each galaxy (early--type, late--type, merged or\u000auncertain), they have estimated the parameters of a Schechter luminosity\u000afunction for early-- and late--type galaxies. However, in their sample there is\u000aa bias against identifying early--type galaxies at large distances and/or faint\u000amagnitudes: in fact, many of the early--type galaxies at faint magnitudes have\u000aprobably been classified as ``uncertain". As discussed in Loveday et al., the\u000aexistence of such a bias is indicated by the fact that for these galaxies\u000a$<V/V_{max}>=0.32$. In this paper we show, both theoretically and through the\u000ause of simulated samples, that this incompleteness strongly biases the derived\u000aparameters of the luminosity function for early--type galaxies. If no\u000acorrection for such incompleteness is applied to the data (as done by Loveday\u000aet al.), one obtains a flatter slope $\u005calpha$ and a brighter $M^*$ with respect\u000ato the real parameters.\u000a

A useful starting point for\u000asuch discussions is a definition of ``quantum coherence''. In this article I\u000agive a definition of quantum coherence and use a number of illustrations to\u000aexplore the implications of this definition. I point to topics of current\u000ainterest in the fields of cosmology and quantum computation where questions of\u000aquantum coherence arise, and I emphasize the impact that interactions with the\u000aenvironment can have on quantum coherence.\u000a

V  The oxygen abundances in the \u005cHII regions of a sample of low surface\u000abrightness (LSB) disk galaxies are presented. In general, LSB galaxies are\u000afound to be metal poor ($Z < {1 \u005cover 3} Z\u005csolar$). Indeed, some LSB galaxies\u000arival the lowest abundance extragalactic objects known. These low metallicities\u000aindicate that LSB galaxies evolve slowly, forming relatively few stars over a\u000aHubble time.\u000a  The low metallicities of LSB galaxies occur even though many are comparable\u000ain size and mass to the prominent spirals which define the Hubble sequence. As\u000awell as being low in surface brightness, these galaxies tend to be isolated.\u000aThis suggests that surface mass density and environment are more relevant to\u000agalaxy evolution than gross size.\u000a  Despite the low surface brightness of the disks, massive ($M > 60 M\u005csolar$)\u000astars are inferred to be present and no abnormality of the IMF is indicated.\u000aMany low excitation \u005cHII regions exist at low metallicity in LSB galaxies, and\u000athe ionization parameter is not tightly correlated with metallicity. However,\u000athere does seem to be a significant envelope of maximum ionization at a given\u000ametallicity.\u000a

V  A large number of stellar evolution models with [Fe/H] = -2.3 and -3.3 have\u000abeen calculated in order to determine the primordial $^7$Li abundance and to\u000atest current stellar evolution models by a comparison to the extensive database\u000aof Li abundances in extremely metal poor halo stars observed by Thorburn\u000a(1994). Standard models do a good job of fitting the observed Li abundances in\u000astars hotter than 5600 K. They predict a primordial $^7$Li abundance of Log\u000aN(Li) = 2.24\u005cpm 0.03$. Models which include microscopic diffusion predict a\u000adownward curvature in the $^7$Li destruction isochrones at hot temperatures\u000awhich is not present in the observations. Thus, the observations clearly rule\u000aout models which include uninhibited microscopic diffusion of $^7$Li from the\u000asurface of the star. The [Fe/H] = -2.3 stellar models which include both\u000adiffusion and rotational mixing provide an excellent match to the observations.\u000aBoth the plateau stars and the heavily depleted cool stars are well fit by\u000athese models. The rotational mixing leads to considerable $^7$Li depletion in\u000athese models and the primordial $^7$Li abundance inferred from these models is\u000aLog N(Li) = $3.08\u005cpm 0.1$.\u000a

The occurrence of winds driven by Supernovae is considered, and the\u000aevolution of the system is computed also after the first wind, allowing for\u000afurther star formation from the restored gas. The evolution of the abundances\u000aof 15 elements or isotopes is followed with detailed stellar nucleosynthesis.\u000aStellar lifetimes are taken into account and a new IMF has been adopted. The\u000agas removal due to the Supernovae explosions depends on the galactic mass and\u000athe presence of dark matter; the subsequent wind episodes are crucial to the\u000aintergalactic gas enrichment. Good agreement is obtained for current SNs rates,\u000aStar Formation Rate and gas masses when compared to the available data.\u000a

V  We use statistical and topological quantities to test the COBE-DMR first year\u000asky maps against the hypothesis that the observed temperature fluctuations\u000areflect Gaussian initial density perturbations with random phases. Recent\u000apapers discuss specific quantities as discriminators between Gaussian and\u000anon-Gaussian behavior, but the treatment of instrumental noise on the data is\u000alargely ignored. The presence of noise in the data biases many statistical\u000aquantities in a manner dependent on both the noise properties and the unknown\u000aCMB temperature field. Appropriate weighting schemes can minimize this effect,\u000abut it cannot be completely eliminated. Analytic expressions are presented for\u000athese biases, and Monte Carlo simulations used to assess the best strategy for\u000adetermining cosmologically interesting information from noisy data. The genus\u000ais a robust discriminator that can be used to estimate the power law\u000aquadrupole-normalized amplitude independently of the 2-point correlation\u000afunction. The genus of the DMR data are consistent with Gaussian initial\u000afluctuations with Q_rms = 15.7 +/- 2.2 - (6.6 +/- 0.3)(n - 1) uK where n is the\u000apower law index. Fitting the rms temperature variations at various smoothing\u000aangles gives Q_rms = 13.2 +/- 2.5 uK and n = 1.7 +0.3 -0.6. While consistent\u000awith Gaussian fluctuations, the first year data are only sufficient to rule out\u000astrongly non-Gaussian distributions of fluctuations.\u000a

V  We have investigated the IRAS colours and the far-IR to optical luminosity\u000aratios of a complete sample of elliptical's and S0's brighter than $B_T = 12$.\u000aOn the average, elliptical galaxies emit in the far-IR less than 1\u005c% of their\u000abolometric luminosity, while S0's are about a factor of three brighter in the\u000afar-IR. On the average, the photospheric emission of red giant stars can\u000aaccount for 50--60\u005c% of the $12\u005cmic$ flux from early type galaxies; the\u000acontribution from diffuse dust at this wavelength is $< 10\u005c%$ in the case of\u000aellipticals,and may amount to 20--40\u005c% for S0's. An additional, $\u005csim\u000a30--40\u005c%$, contribution from circumstellar emission from evolved giants with\u000amass loss (particularly OH/IR stars) seems to be required in the case of\u000aellipticals. This suggests a small but significant star formation activity in\u000athese galaxies at a look-back time of 1--$2\u005c,$Gyr, corresponding to about 10\u005c%\u000aof that typical of a disk galaxy having the same V-band luminosity. As for\u000aS0's, the larger diffuse dust emission may swamp to some extent that of\u000acircumstellar dust, which is indicated to be, on the average, $\u005clsim 20\u005c%$. The\u000aweak emission from diffuse interstellar dust, detected mostly at $60\u005cmic$ and\u000a$100\u005cmic$, has color temperatures similar to those of disk galaxies; as in that\u000acase of the latter, a warm dust component is suggested, associated to\u000astar-forming regions. The implied star formation would be a few percent of that\u000aof disk galaxies of similar V-band luminosity and could account for a fraction\u000aof the observed UV branch of early type galaxies.\u000a

In spite of mounting evidence from surface\u000aphotometry and from study of the gas kinematics that the Galactic bulge is not\u000aaxisymmetric, the stellar kinematics in Baade's Window are very similar to\u000athose of an isotropic oblate rotator.

V  We calculate the spectrum of blast wave models of gamma-ray burst sources,\u000afor various assumptions about the magnetic field density and the relativistic\u000aparticle acceleration efficiency. For a range of physically plausible models we\u000afind that the radiation efficiency is high, and leads to nonthermal spectra\u000awith breaks at various energies comparable to those observed in the gamma-ray\u000arange. Radiation is also predicted at other wavebands, in particular at X-ray,\u000aoptical/UV and GeV/TeV energies. We discuss the spectra as a function of\u000aduration for three basic types of models, and for cosmological, halo and\u000agalactic disk distances. We also evaluate the gamma-ray fluences and the\u000aspectral characteristics for a range of external densities. Impulsive burst\u000amodels at cosmological distances can satisfy the conventional X-ray paucity\u000aconstraint $S_x/S_\u005cgamma \u005csiml$ few percent over a wide range of durations, but\u000agalactic models can do so only for bursts shorter than a few seconds, unless\u000aadditional assumptions are made. The emissivity is generally larger for bursts\u000ain a denser external environment, with the efficiency increasing up to the\u000apoint where all the energy input is radiated away.\u000a

V  We present preliminary results of our investigation into the influence of\u000ashear fields on the evolution of galactic scale fluctuations in a primordial\u000aGaussian random density field. Specifically, we study how the matter associated\u000awith a galaxy-scale peak evolves, to determine whether the shear can affect the\u000apeak's ability to form a virialized structure. We find that the evolution of\u000athe mass distribution in the immediate surroundings of $\u005cgeq 1\u005csigma$ initial\u000adensity peaks is sensitive to the nature and magnitude of the shear. Its final\u000afate and configuration spans a plethora of possibilities, ranging from\u000aaccretion onto the peak to complete disruption. On the other hand, the mass\u000adefining the peak itself always tends to form a virialized object, though a\u000agiven galaxy-scale peak need not necessarily form only one halo. Furthermore,\u000agalaxy-size halos need not necessarily be associated with initial galaxy-scale\u000adensity peaks. Under certain conditions, the shear field is capable of breaking\u000aup a single primordial peak into two (and perhaps, more) distinct halos, or of\u000apromoting the growth of smaller-scale peaks into galaxy-size halos.\u000a

V  We present the results of a $\u005clambda$20 cm VLA observation of the compact\u000aGalactic center radio source Sgr A$^*$. The scatter-broadened image is\u000aelongated in the East-West direction, with an axial ratio of 0.6$\u005cpm$0.05 and a\u000aposition angle of 87$^0\u005cpm$3$^0$. A similar shape and orientation has been\u000afound previously at shorter wavelengths using VLBI and VLBA. Both the major and\u000aminor axes follow the $\u005clambda^2$ law appropriate for scattering by turbulence\u000ain the intervening medium. Assuming that the anisotropy is caused by a magnetic\u000afield permeating the scattering medium, we argue that the scattering occurs\u000awithin extended HII regions lying in the central 100 pc of the Galaxy. The\u000amagnetic field in this region must be poloidal, organized and is estimated to\u000ahave a strength of at least 30 to 100 $\u005cmu$Gauss.\u000a

V  The effects of magnetic fields on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis(BBN) have been\u000acalculated, and the impact on the abundances of the light elements have been\u000ainvestigated numerically. An upper limit on the strength of primordial magnetic\u000afields compatible with observations of light element abundances has been thus\u000aobtained. In the framework of standard BBN theory, the maximum strength of the\u000aprimordial magnetic fields, on scales greater than $10^4$cm but smaller than\u000athe event horizon at the BBN epoch ($\u005csim 1$ min., $\u005csim 2\u005ctimes 10^{12}$cm),\u000ais $\u005cle 10^{11}$ Gauss. This limit is shown to allow magnetic fields at the\u000atime of recombination no stronger than $\u005csim 0.1$ gauss on scales $\u005cge\u000a10^{11}{\u005crm cm}$. Our results also strongly indicate that, at the BBN epoch,\u000aand for field strengths $B\u005cle10^{13}$gauss, the effects of magnetic fields on\u000athe primordial abundances of light elements are dominated by effects from\u000areaction rates in the presense of primeval magnetic fields rather than by\u000amagnetic density effects on the expansion rate.\u000a

V  Globular clusters cores harbour many low-mass X-ray binaries, cataclysmic\u000avariables, and millisecond pulsar binaries which are likely to have been formed\u000avia the process of tidal capture. Tidal capture binaries were originally\u000athought to be responsible for halting core collapse and for subsequent\u000are-expansion via the process of ``binary heating''. The standard model, now\u000asuggests that these binaries are no longer viable as a direct energy source. We\u000apresent the results of a study which suggests that tidal capture binaries may\u000aindeed be a significant direct source of energy for the cores of globular\u000aclusters. We show that following capture, these binaries go through a short,\u000aviolent chaotic phase, with the orbital eccentricity (and hence the tidal\u000aenergy) suffering large changes on a very short timescale. This is followed by\u000aa long quiescent phase in which the tidal energy remains small while the orbit\u000acircularizes only via normal dissipative effects. This quiescent phase allows\u000acaptured main sequence stars to evolve in the absence of large tides, a fact\u000aimportant for the production of low-mass X-ray binaries and cataclysmic\u000avariables.\u000a

V  To examine how peculiar velocities can affect the 2-, 3-, and 4-point\u000aredshift correlation functions, we evaluate volume-average correlations for\u000aconfigurations that emphasize and minimize redshift distortions for four\u000adifferent volume-limited samples from each of the CfA, SSRS, and IRAS redshift\u000acatalogs. We find a characteristic distortion for the 2-point correlation,\u000a$\u005cxibar_2$: the slope $\u005cgamma$ is flatter and the correlation length is larger\u000ain redshift space than in real space; that is, redshift distortions ``move''\u000acorrelations from small to large scales. At the largest scales (up to $12\u000a\u005cMpc$), the extra power in the redshift distribution is compatible with\u000a$\u005cOmega^{4/7}/b \u005capprox 1$. We estimate $\u005cOmega^{4/7}/b$ to be $0.53 \u005cpm 0.15$,\u000a$1.10 \u005cpm 0.16$ and $0.84 \u005cpm 0.45$ for the CfA, SSRS and IRAS catalogs. Higher\u000aorder correlations $\u005cxibar_3$ and $\u005cxibar_4$ suffer similar redshift\u000adistortions, but in such a way that, within the accuracy of our analysis, the\u000anormalized amplitudes $S_3$ and $S_4$ are insensitive to this effect. The\u000ahierarchical amplitudes $S_3$ and $S_4$ are constant as a function of scale\u000abetween 1--$12 \u005cMpc$ and have similar values in all samples and catalogues,\u000a$S_3 \u005capprox 2$ and $S_4 \u005capprox 6$, despite the fact that $\u005cxibar_2$,\u000a$\u005cxibar_3$, and $\u005cxibar_4$ differ from one sample to another by large factors\u000a(up to a factor of 4 in $\u005cxibar_2$, 8 for $\u005cxibar_3$, and 12 for $\u005cxibar_4$).\u000aThe agreement between the independent estimations of $S_3$ and $S_4$\u000a

V  We present optical spectra of QSO HS~1946+7658 with either high resolution\u000a(FWHM=10 km/s) or high signal to noise ratio (SNR=40-100). We find 113 Lyman\u000aalpha and six metal line systems. The metal systems at Zabs=2.844 and 3.050\u000ahave complex velocity structures. We find that the system at 2.844 is a damped\u000aLy-a absorption system, with neutral hydrogen column density of\u000alogN(HI)=20.2+/-0.4, and it is the cause of the Lyman limit break at 3520\u005cAA.\u000aThe metal abundance in the gas phase of the system is [M/H]=-2.6+/-0.3, with a\u000abest estimate of [M/H]= -2.8, with ionization parameter Gamma=-2.75, from a\u000aphotoionization model. We show that the abundance ratios rule out appreciable\u000adust in this DLA system. We do not see the enhancement of O over C reported in\u000aNature by Reimers last years. We see CII*(1335) offset by 15 km/s with respect\u000ato CII(1334), presumably because the gas density varies from 2 - 8 cm(-3) with\u000achanging velocity in the DLA system. These densities imply that the damped\u000acomponent is 6 - 25 pc thick, which is reasonable for a single cloud in a cold\u000aspiral disk. We see a 2.6sigma lack of Ly-a forest lines well away from the QSO\u000aredshift, which may be a chance fluctuation. We also see a correlation between\u000acolumn density N(HI) and Doppler parameter b for 96 unsaturated Ly-a forest\u000aabsorption lines, and although this correlation persists in the 36 Ly-a lines\u000awhich lie in regions where SNR=8-16, we agree with Rauch etal (1993) that it is\u000aprobably a bogus effect of low SNR. We show that there are few low-b Ly-a\u000aforest lines in moderate SNR data.\u000a

V  We consider the stimulated emission of gravitons from an initial state of\u000athermal equilibrium, under the action of the cosmic gravitational background\u000afield. We find that the low-energy graviton spectrum is enhanced if compared\u000awith spontaneous creation from the vacuum; as a consequence, the scale of\u000ainflation must be lowered, in order not to exceed the observed CMB quadrupole\u000aanisotropy. This effect is particularly important for models based on a\u000asymmetry-breaking transition which require, as initial condition, a state of\u000athermal equilibrium at temperatures of the order of the inflation scale.\u000a

V  We present 3D Newtonian simulations of the coalescence of two neutron stars,\u000ausing a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code. We begin the simulations\u000awith the two stars in a hard, circular binary, and have them spiral together as\u000aangular momentum is lost through gravitational radiation at the rate predicted\u000aby modeling the system as two point masses. We model the neutron stars as hard\u000apolytropes ($\u005cgamma=2.4$) of equal mass, and investigate the effect of the\u000ainitial spin of the two stars on the coalescence. The process of coalescence,\u000afrom initial contact to the formation of an axially symmetric object, takes\u000aonly a few orbital periods. Some of the material from the two neutron stars is\u000ashed, forming a thick disk around the central, coalesced object. The mass of\u000athis disk is dependent on the initial neutron star spins; higher spin rates\u000aresulting in greater mass loss, and thus more massive disks. For spin rates\u000athat are most likely to be applicable to real systems, the central coalesced\u000aobject has a mass of $2.4M_\u005codot$, which is tantalizingly close to the maximum\u000amass allowed by any neutron star equation of state for an object that is\u000asupported in part by rotation. Using a realistic nuclear equation of state, we\u000aestimate the temperature of the material after the coalescence. We find that\u000athe central object is at a temperature of $\u005csim 10$MeV, whilst the disk is\u000aheated by shocks to a temperature of 2-4MeV.\u000a

V  We present a new analytic study of the equilibrium and stability properties\u000aof close binary systems containing polytropic components. Our method is based\u000aon the use of ellipsoidal trial functions in an energy variational principle.\u000aWe consider both synchronized and nonsynchronized systems, constructing the\u000acompressible generalizations of the classical Darwin and Darwin-Riemann\u000aconfigurations. Our method can be applied to a wide variety of binary models\u000awhere the stellar masses, radii, spins, entropies, and polytropic indices are\u000aall allowed to vary over wide ranges and independently for each component. We\u000afind that both secular and dynamical instabilities can develop before a Roche\u000alimit or contact is reached along a sequence of models with decreasing binary\u000aseparation. High incompressibility always makes a given binary system more\u000asusceptible to these instabilities, but the dependence on the mass ratio is\u000amore complicated. As simple applications, we construct models of double\u000adegenerate systems and of low-mass main-sequence-star binaries. We also discuss\u000athe orbital evolution of close binary systems under the combined influence of\u000afluid viscosity and secular angular momentum losses from processes like\u000agravitational radiation. We show that the existence of global fluid\u000ainstabilities can have a profound effect on the terminal evolution of\u000acoalescing binaries. The validity of our analytic solutions is examined by\u000ameans of detailed comparisons with the results of recent numerical fluid\u000acalculations in three dimensions.\u000a

The general form of the\u000ainflationary potential which produces such a spectrum is a hyperbolic function\u000aand is interpreted physically as a bulk viscous stress contribution to the\u000aenergy-momentum of a perfect baryotropic fluid. This is equivalent to expanding\u000athe equation of state as a truncated Taylor series. Particle physics models\u000awhich lead to such a potential are discussed.\u000a

V  The formation and evolution of an X--ray cluster is studied using a 3--D\u000aN-body + hydrodynamical simulation which includes feedback of energy and iron\u000afrom cluster galaxies. The differences in evolution and final state between the\u000asimulation and a similar run without feedback are highlighted. We address the\u000aenergetics of cluster gas; the distribution of dark matter, gas, and galaxies;\u000athe thermodynamic state of cluster gas, the beta model, and the beta\u000adiscrepancy; x-ray evolution; the validity of estimates of the binding mass and\u000aof the baryon fraction of the cluster; dynamics of the galaxy population and\u000avelocity bias; and of the evolution of the iron abundance distribution in the\u000acluster. We find that preheating by galactic winds results in a lower core\u000adensity for the ICM, which in turn makes the simulated cluster fainter at high\u000aredshift and undergo rapid luminosity evolution to the present. A strong iron\u000aabundance gradient is present, even at high redshift. Velocity bias is present\u000ain the galaxy population; this bias combined with the preheating from winds\u000adrives the value of $\u005cbeta_{spec}\u005c,=\u005c,\u005csigma^{2}/\u005cleft(kT/\u005cmu m_{p}\u005cright)$ to\u000avalues less than one.

V  The ionization history of the universe provides a major source of ambiguity\u000ain constraining cosmological models using small angular scale microwave\u000abackground anisotropies. To clarify these issues, we consider a complete\u000atreatment of Compton scattering to second order, an approach which may be\u000aapplicable to other astrophysical situations. We find that only the ${\u005ccal O}\u000a(v)$ Doppler effect, and the ${\u005ccal O} (v\u005cdelta)$ Vishniac effect are important\u000afor recent last scattering epochs; the ${\u005ccal O} (v^2)$ Doppler effect is not\u000asignificant on any angular scale, and other higher-order effects are completely\u000anegligible. However the ${\u005ccal O}(v^2)$ effect does lead to \u005cCy\u005c distortions,\u000awhich although generally below current constraints, set an unavoidable minimum\u000alevel in reionization models. We consider the small-angle approximation for the\u000aVishniac effect in detail, and show several improvements over previous\u000atreatments, particularly for low $\u005cOmega_0$. For standard cold dark matter\u000amodels, the effect of reionization is to redistribute the anisotropies to\u000aarcminute scales; late reionization leads to partially erased primary\u000afluctuations and a secondary contribution of comparable magnitude. Using recent\u000aanisotropy limits from the ATCA experiment, we set new constraints on baryonic\u000adark matter models. Stronger constraints are imposed (in second order) upon\u000amodels with higher Hubble constant, steeper $n$, and higher density. These\u000alimits depend on the specific ionization history assumed, but the factor gained\u000aby lowering the ionization fraction is generally small, and may be tested by\u000acurrently-planned\u000a

V  We analyze the consequences of models of structure formation for higher-order\u000a($n$-point) galaxy correlation functions in the mildly non-linear regime.\u000aSeveral variations of the standard $\u005cOmega=1$ cold dark matter model with\u000ascale-invariant primordial perturbations have recently been introduced to\u000aobtain more power on large scales, 20 h$^{-1}$ Mpc, e.g., low-matter-density\u000a(non-zero cosmological constant) models, `tilted' primordial spectra, and\u000ascenarios with a mixture of cold and hot dark matter. They also include models\u000awith an effective scale-dependent bias, such as the cooperative galaxy\u000aformation scenario of Bower, etal. (1993). We show that higher-order galaxy\u000acorrelation functions can provide a useful test of such models and can\u000adiscriminate between models with true large-scale power in the density field\u000aand those where the galaxy power arises from scale-dependent bias: a bias with\u000arapid scale-dependence leads to a dramatic decrease of the hierarchical\u000aamplitudes at large scales. Current observational constraints on the\u000athree-point amplitudes $Q_3$ and $S_3$ can place limits on the bias\u000aparameter(s) and appear to disfavor, but not yet rule out, the hypothesis that\u000ascale-dependent bias is responsible for the extra power observed on large\u000ascales.\u000a

V  In this talk we discuss three different issues. First of all, there exist\u000aseveral proposals how to solve cosmological problems by adiabatic expansion of\u000athe Universe, without any use of inflation. We explain why these models do not\u000asolve the flatness/entropy problem. On the other hand there exist some claims\u000athat inflation also does not solve the flatness problem. We show that these\u000aclaims are correct to a certain extent for old and new inflation, but are\u000aincorrect for simplest versions of chaotic inflation. The second issue to be\u000aconsidered is the classification of inflationary models. At present many\u000ainflationary models are compared to each other in order to understand which of\u000athem better describes observational data. Unfortunately, this often leads to\u000aterminological misunderstandings and even to misleading conclusions. We discuss\u000athree coexisting types of classification of inflationary models and explain\u000atheir relation to each other. We also briefly describe the hybrid inflation\u000amodel, which combines several interesting features of different inflationary\u000amodels. Finally we show that it is possible to describe inflationary universe\u000aby a stationary (i.e. time-independent) probability distribution to find a\u000adomain of a given size containing matter with given properties. This represents\u000aa strong deviation of inflationary cosmology from the standard Big Bang\u000aparadigm.\u000a

In previous work we studied\u000athe accuracy of several analytic approximations to gravitational clustering in\u000athe mildly nonlinear regime. We found that the ``truncated Zel'dovich\u000aapproximation" (TZA) was better than any other (except in one case the ordinary\u000aZeldovich approximation) over a wide range from linear to mildly nonlinear\u000a($\u005csigma \u005csim 3$) regimes. TZA sets Fourier amplitudes equal to zero for {\u005cit\u000aall} wavenumbers greater than $k_{n\u005cell}$, where $k_{n\u005cell}$ marks the\u000atransition to the nonlinear regime. Here, we study crosscorrelation of\u000ageneralized TZA with a group of $n$--body simulations for three shapes of\u000awindow function: sharp $k$--truncation (as in CMS), tophat in coordinate space,\u000aor a Gaussian. We also study the crosscorrelation as a function of initial\u000ascale within each window type. We find $k$--truncation, which was so much\u000abetter than other things tried in CMS, is the {it worst} of these three window\u000ashapes. We find that a Gaussian window $e^{-k^2/2k_G^2}$ applied to the intial\u000aFourier amplitudes is the best choice. It produces a greatly improved\u000acrosscorrelation all cases we studied. The optimum choice of $k_G$ for the\u000aGaussian window is (spectrum-- dependent) 1--1.5 times $k_{n\u005cell}$, with\u000a$k_{n\u005cell}$ defined by (3). Although all three windows produce similar power\u000aspectra and density distribution functions after application of the Zeldovich\u000aapproximation, phase agreement with the $n$--body simulation is better for the\u000aGaussian window. We ascribe Gaussian window success to its superior treatment\u000aof phase evolution.\u000a

V  OBSERVATIONS of galaxies to very faint magnitudes have revealed a population\u000aof blue galaxies at intermediate redshift$^{1-5}$. These galaxies represent a\u000asignificant excess over the expectation of standard cosmological models for\u000areasonable amounts of evolution of the locally observed galaxy population.\u000aHowever, the surveys which define the local galaxy population are strongly\u000abiased against objects of low surface brightness$^{6-9}$. Low surface\u000abrightness galaxies have properties very similar to those of the excess blue\u000apopulation$^{10,11}$, and recent work suggests that they are comparable in\u000aabundance to the more readily detected normal galaxies$^{9,12}$. I show that\u000athe very deep surveys which reveal the excess population can easily detect low\u000asurface brightness galaxies to large redshifts, but that local surveys will\u000amiss them because they are not comparably sensitive. This suggests that the\u000aexcess faint galaxies {\u005cit are\u005c/} low surface brightness galaxies. No\u000aalteration of standard cosmology is required, but it is necessary to reconsider\u000athe way in which the galaxy distribution function is specified.\u000a

V  We develop a new formalism to study the dynamics of fluid polytropes in three\u000adimensions. The stars are modeled as compressible ellipsoids and the\u000ahydrodynamic equations are reduced to a set of ordinary differential equations\u000afor the evolution of the principal axes and other global quantities. Both\u000aviscous dissipation and the gravitational radiation reaction are incorporated.\u000aWe establish the validity of our approximations and demonstrate the simplicity\u000aand power of the method by rederiving a number of known results concerning the\u000astability and dynamical oscillations of rapidly rotating polytropes. In\u000aparticular, we present a generalization to compressible fluids of\u000aChandrasekhar's classical results for the secular and dynamical instabilities\u000aof incompressible Maclaurin spheroids. We also present several applications of\u000aour method to astrophysical problems of great current interest such as the\u000atidal disruption of a star by a massive black hole, the coalescence of compact\u000abinaries driven by the emission of gravitational waves, and the development of\u000ainstabilities in close binary systems.\u000a

V  The reconstruction of the peculiar velocity field from the 1.936~Jy iras\u000aselected sample of galaxies is compared to a similar reconstruction from an\u000aoptically selected sample. A general method for combining different samples to\u000areconstruct a self-consistent density and peculiar velocity field is presented.\u000aThe method is applied to determine how sensitive the derived peculiar velocity\u000afield is to the characteristics of the sample used. The possibility that the\u000airas galaxies do not trace the general galaxy population is explored adopting a\u000asimple model of linear biasing between the iras and optical samples. We find\u000athat the velocity fields derived from the two samples are consistent, within\u000athe estimated shot noise error, for the case of no relative bias. This result\u000asuggests that the predicted peculiar velocity field based on iras samples is\u000anot sensitive to the sampling properties of iras galaxies. Combined with\u000aprevious suggestion of a relative biasing of iras galaxies on small scales\u000a(about 5 h^-1Mpc), this result suggests scale dependent biasing.\u000a

V  There exists a growing body of observational evidence supporting a\u000anon-vanishing cosmological constant at the present epoch. We examine the\u000apossibility that such a term may arise directly from the potential energy which\u000adrove an inflationary expansion of the very early universe. To avoid arbitrary\u000aalterations in the shape of this potential at various epochs it is necessary to\u000aintroduce a time-dependent viscosity into the system. The evolution of the\u000aeffective Planck mass in scalar-tensor theories is a natural candidate for such\u000aan effect. In these models there are observational constraints arising from\u000aanisotropies in the cosmic microwave background, large-scale galactic\u000astructure, observations of the primordial Helium abundance and solar system\u000atests of general relativity. Decaying power law and exponential potentials are\u000aconsidered, but for these models it is very difficult to simultaneously satisfy\u000aall of the limits. This may have implications for the joint evolution of the\u000agravitational and cosmological constants.\u000a

V  Using the concept of open systems where the classical geometry is treated as\u000athe system and the quantum matter field as the environment, we derive a\u000afluctuation-dissipation theorem for semiclassical cosmology. This theorem which\u000aexists under very general conditions for dissipations in the dynamics of the\u000asystem, and the noise and fluctuations in the environment, can be traced to the\u000aformal mathematical relation between the dissipation and noise kernels of the\u000ainfluence functional depicting the open system, and is ultimately a consequence\u000aof the unitarity of the closed system. In particular, for semiclassical\u000agravity, it embodies the backreaction effect of matter fields on the dynamics\u000aof spacetime. The backreaction equation derivable from the influence action is\u000ain the form of a Einstein-Langevin equation. It contains a dissipative term in\u000athe equation of motion for the dynamics of spacetime and a noise term related\u000ato the fluctuations of particle creation in the matter field. Using the\u000awell-studied model of a quantum scalar field in a Bianchi Type-I universe we\u000aillustrate how this Langevin equation and the noise term are derived and show\u000ahow the creation of particles and the dissipation of anisotropy during the\u000aexpansion of the universe can be understood as a manifestation of this\u000afluctuation-dissipation relation.\u000a

V  High spectral and spatial resolution observations of the HCO+ molecule toward\u000athe T Tau binary system obtained with the Owens Valley Millimeter Array reveal\u000aa broad emission line profile (V_LSR = 7.2 km/s, width = 2.0 km/s) upon which a\u000anarrow, redshifted absorption feature (V_LSR = 8.5 km/s, width +/- 0.5 km/s) is\u000asuperposed. One possible interpretation of the absorption is that it arises\u000afrom infall of molecular cloud envelope material onto the immediate\u000acircumbinary region, which would imply that large scale dynamic accretion\u000aprocesses are still active well into the optically visible stages of star\u000aformation. Provided the mass is deposited at radii sufficiently close to the\u000ayoung stars, estimates of the accretion rates indicate that infall may add\u000aenough material to the system to account for the FU~Orionis type flares\u000arecently observed in T~Tau in =< 100 yr.\u000a

V  The rotation curves of 20 spiral galaxies are examined in the light of a toy\u000amodel (Soares 1992) which has as the main feature the assignment of a high M/L\u000aratio (=30; Ho=50 km/s/Mpc) to the visible matter. The observed rotation of all\u000agalaxies can be accommodated without the assumption of a dark halo.\u000a  Moreover, the suggestion is made that the fact that almost all available\u000arotational velocity measurements are derived from emission lines emitted by\u000agalaxian gas (either neutral or ionized) makes them inappropriate as tracers of\u000athe galaxy gravitational potential. To account for that, the model introduces\u000aan effective potential meant to describe the hydrodynamics inside a gaseous\u000adisk. The general morphology of the curves (i.e., the presence of a plateau in\u000aV(r) X r) is interpreted in this framework as a consequence of the\u000ahydrodynamical characteristics of galaxian disks.\u000a  The Tully-Fisher relation is expressed in terms of model parameters and used\u000aas an additional constraint in the process of fitting the model to the observed\u000arotation of the galaxies.\u000a

V  This is a somewhat extended version of the original July 93 report. It is\u000aproved that the cosmological density perturbation is associated with a peculiar\u000avelocity field. This allows a simple formulation of cosmological perturbation\u000atheory, which works entirely with quasi-Newtonian fluid flow equations. As an\u000aillustration, the large scale cosmic microwave background anisotropy\u000a(Sachs-Wolfe effect) is calculated without any reference to the metric\u000aperturbation. In addition, assuming the usual adiabatic initial condition on\u000athe density perturbation, we show that the dipole of the anisotropy measures\u000aour peculiar velocity relative to the average peculiar velocity within the last\u000ascattering surface of the microwave background, thus defining its frame of\u000areference.\u000a

V  Extremely high velocity (EHV) wings, with full widths of 72 to 140 km/s, are\u000aseen on the CO J=3-2 lines toward W3 IRS 5, GL 490, NGC 2071, W28 A2, GL 2591,\u000aS140, and Cepheus A.\u000a  The results of our survey suggest that EHV wings are common around infrared\u000asources of moderate to high luminosity (500 to 4x10^5 Lsun) in dense regions.\u000aLine ratios imply that the EHV gas is usually optically thin and warm.\u000aCharacteristic velocities range from 20 to 40 km/s, yielding timescales of\u000a1600-4200 yr. Since most sources in this study are producing some ionizing\u000aphotons, these short timescales suggest that neutral winds coexist with\u000aionizing photons.\u000a  We examined two possible sources for the EHV CO emission: a neutral stellar\u000awind; and swept-up or entrained molecular gas. Neither can be ruled out. If the\u000ahigh-velocity (HV) gas is swept up by a momentum-conserving stellar wind traced\u000aby the extremely high velocity CO emission, most of the C in the winds from\u000aluminous objects cannot be in CO. If the EHV and HV forces are equal, the\u000afraction of C in a form other than CO increases with source luminosity and with\u000athe production rate of ionizing photons.\u000a

V  New high resolution 6 cm observations have been made on Cepheus A using\u000aMERLIN, and combined with new VLA observations at 3.7 cm. Angular resolution\u000awith the latter was 200 mas, and with MERLIN was 60 mas, except for isolated\u000aunresolved sources where 33 mas was achieved. Unresolved objects at 60 mas were\u000aobserved in Sources 2, 3, and in particular 9 which also was not resolved at 33\u000amas. There is no evidence for any other object as small as this with any\u000asignificant flux density, although Source 8 was quiescent at the time. The\u000aupper limit to the size of Source 9 sets a minimum brightness temperature of\u000a4.3 $\u005ctimes$ 10$^5$K, and adds credence to a previous suggestion that it is a\u000agyrosynchrotron source. The compact objects of Sources 2 and 3 are thought to\u000abe produced by mass outflow from stars, which could be of spectral type B0 -\u000aB1, but this is uncertain. There is a discussion regarding the powerhouse for\u000athe molecular outflow. Sources 8 and 9, which are the highly time dependent\u000aobjects, appear at the centre of the disruption of the high density gas, and\u000atheir estimated high temperature of 10$^7$ - 10$^8$K indicates that they could\u000aproduce high velocity winds. On the other hand, the OH masers surrounding\u000aSource 2(ii) show an outward velocity of about 10 km s${-1}$, which is small,\u000abut higher velocity winds could tunnel through adjacent spaces, and even be\u000aresponsible for the 300 km s${-1}$ bullet of Source 7. An extrapolation of the\u000aorthogonals to the IR polarization vectors are not accurate enough to pinpoint\u000athe source of the IR radiation, but it is estimated that Sources 2(ii) and\u000a3(d)(ii) could\u000a

V  We discuss the fragmentation of a filamentary cloud on the basis of a\u000a1-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation of a self-gravitating gas cloud. The\u000asimulation shows that dense cores are produced with a semi-regular interval in\u000aspace and time from one edge to the other. At the initial stage the gas near\u000aone of the edges is attracted inwards by gravity and the accumulation of the\u000agas makes a dense core near the edge. When the dense core grows in mass up to a\u000acertain amount, it gathers gas from the other direction. Accordingly the dense\u000acore becomes isolated from the main cloud and the parent filamentary cloud has\u000aa new edge. This cycle repeats and the fragmentation process propagates towards\u000athe other edge. The propagation speed is a few tens of percent larger than the\u000asound speed. According to the theory, the age difference for the northwest-most\u000aand southeast-most cores in TMC-1 is estimated to be 0.68~pc/0.6~km~s$^{-1}$ =\u000a$ 10 ^6 $~y. The estimated age difference is consistent with that obtained from\u000athe chemical chronology.\u000a

V  We compare different nonlinear approximations to gravitational clustering in\u000athe weakly nonlinear regime, using as a comparative statistic the evolution of\u000anon-Gaussianity which can be characterised by a set of numbers $S_p$ describing\u000aconnected moments of the density field at the lowest order in $<\u005cdelta^2>$:\u000a$<\u005cdelta^n>_c \u005csimeq S_n<\u005cdelta^2>^{n-1}$. Generalizing earlier work by\u000aBernardeau (1992) we develop an ansatz to evaluate all $S_p$ in a given\u000aapproximation by means of a generating function which can be shown to satisfy\u000athe equations of motion of a homogeneous spherical density enhancement in that\u000aapproximation. On the basis of the values of we show that approximations\u000aformulated in Lagrangian space (such as the Zeldovich approximation and its\u000aextensions) are considerably more accurate than those formulated in Eulerian\u000aspace such as the Frozen Flow and Linear Potential approximations. In\u000aparticular we find that the $n$th order Lagrangian perturbation approximation\u000acorrectly reproduces the first $n+1$ parameters $S_n$. We also evaluate the\u000adensity probability distribution function for the different approximations in\u000athe quasi-linear regime and compare our results with an exact analytic\u000atreatment in the case of the Zeldovich approximation.\u000a

V  The statistical properties of galaxy distance estimators are studied and a\u000arigorous framework is developed for identifying and removing the effects of\u000aMalmquist bias due to obsevational selection. The prescription of Schechter\u000a(1980) for defining unbiased distance estimators is extended to more general --\u000aand more realistic -- cases. The derivation of `optimal' unbiased distance\u000aestimators of minimum dispersion, by utilising information from additional --\u000asuitably correlated -- observables, is discussed and the results applied to a\u000acalibrating sample from the Fornax cluster, as used in the Mathewson spiral\u000agalaxy redshift survey. The optimal distance estimator derived from I-band\u000amagnitude, diameter and 21cm line width has an intrinsic scatter which is 25 \u005c%\u000asmaller than that of the Tully-Fisher relation quoted for this calibrating\u000asample.

V  We examine the vertical structure and equilibrium of the molecular gas layer\u000ain the galactic disk, measuring its scale height and velocity dispersion as a\u000afunction of Galactic radius by modeling the CO emission at the tangent points.\u000aThe model takes into account emission from a large path length along the line\u000aof sight, corresponding to an interval \u005cDelta R ~ 200-400 pc; and is\u000aparametrized by the scale height of the gas, the centroid in z, the rotation\u000avelocity and the velocity dispersion. This model is then fit to the $^{12}CO$\u000asurvey of Knapp et al.(1985) to determine the best fit parameters. The reduced\u000a\u005cchi^2 from fitting the models (considering only the photon statistics) range\u000afrom 2 to 19. The main source of error is the `shot noise' due to the small\u000anumber of clouds. Simulations using discrete molecular clouds are carried out\u000ato estimate the errors. The scale height of the molecular gas increases with\u000aradius. The velocity dispersion varies from ~ 2 km/s to 11 km/s with a typical\u000auncertainty of ~3 km/s and shows a monotonic increase with galactic radius. The\u000amidplane mass density of the disk calculated from the scale-height and velocity\u000adispersion is consistent with the local value \u005crho_0(R_0) of 0.2 \u005cmsun pc^{-3}.\u000a

V  If gamma ray burst sources are in the galactic halo they inevitably involve a\u000acreation of an opaque pair plasma fireball, just like in cosmological sources.\u000aWe find that the typical physical conditions in a galactic halo fireball are:\u000aoptical depth $\u005cap 10^8$, thermal energy $\u005cap 100 KeV$, maximal relativstic\u000aexpansion $\u005cG \u005cap 300 $ and a maximal baryonic load of $\u005cap 10^{-15} M_\u005codot$.\u000aThis does not rule out galctic halo models but it poses an addtional severe\u000aconstraint on all such sources. A comparison of these conditions with the\u000aphysical conditions at cosmological fireballs reveal that galactic halo\u000afireballs are less favorable than cosmological ones as sources of gamma ray\u000abursts.\u000a

V  We simulated the behavior of interstellar gas clouds in a companion galaxy\u000aduring a gas-dynamical interaction with the halo and disk of a spiral galaxy.\u000aBy ram pressure, the gas clouds are stripped from the companion, and accreted\u000ato ward the disk of the spiral galaxy. If the companion's orbit is retrograde\u000awith respect to the rotation of the spiral galaxy, infalling clouds hit the\u000anuclear region. Angular momentum transfer causes disruption of the inner\u000agaseous disk, and makes a void of interstellar gas in the bulge. If the\u000acompanion's orbit is either prograde or polar, infalling clouds are accreted by\u000athe outer disk, and form a rotating gas ring. We show that the ram-pressure\u000astripping-and-accretion is one way from the companion to a gas-rich larger\u000agalaxy, which causes disposal of interstellar gas from the companion and\u000aeffectively changes its galaxy type into earlier (redder). The ram-pressure\u000aprocess is significant durig merger of galaxies, in which interstellar gas is\u000astripped and accreted prior to the stellar-body merger. Based on the\u000asimulation, we discuss a possible history of interstellar gas in M31 system,\u000awhich comprises M32, NGC 205 and possible merged galaxies. The ram-pressure\u000astripping explains the disposal of mass lost from evolving stars in the dwarf\u000aelliptical companion M32.\u000a

V  We show how to measure cosmological parameters using observations of\u000ainspiraling binary neutron star or black hole systems in one or more\u000agravitational wave detectors. To illustrate, we focus on the case of fixed mass\u000abinary systems observed in a single Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave\u000aObservatory (LIGO)-like detector. Using realistic detector noise estimates, we\u000acharacterize the rate of detections as a function of a threshold\u000asignal-to-noise ratio $\u005crho_0$, the Hubble constant $H_0$, and the binary\u000a``chirp'' mass. For $\u005crho_0 = 8$, $H_0 = 100$ km/s/Mpc, and $1.4 \u005cmsun$ neutron\u000astar binaries, the sample has a median redshift of $0.22$. Under the same\u000aassumptions but independent of $H_0$, a conservative rate density of coalescing\u000abinaries ($8\u005ctimes10^{-8}\u005c,{\u005crm yr}^{-1}\u005c,{\u005crm Mpc}^{-3}$) implies LIGO will\u000aobserve $\u005csim 50\u005c,{\u005crm yr}^{-1}$ binary inspiral events. The precision with\u000awhich $H_0$ and the deceleration parameter $q_0$ may be determined depends on\u000athe number of observed inspirals. For fixed mass binary systems, $\u005csim 100$\u000aobservations with $\u005crho_0 = 10$ in the LIGO detector will give $H_0$ to 10\u005c% in\u000aan Einstein-DeSitter cosmology, and 3000 will give $q_0$ to 20\u005c%. For the\u000aconservative rate density of coalescing binaries, 100 detections with $\u005crho_0 =\u000a10$ will require about 4~yrs.\u000a

V  We present analyses of the two-point correlation function derived from an\u000aall-sky redshift survey of 5313 galaxies extracted from the Infrared\u000aAstronomical Satellite (IRAS) database. The redshift space correlation function\u000a\u005cxi(s) is well described by a power law, $\u005cxi(s) = (s/4.53h^{-1}{\u005crm\u000aMpc})^{-1.28}$, on scales \u005csimlt 20\u005cmpc; on larger scales \u005cxi(s) drops below\u000athe extension of this power law. We examine the effect of redshift space\u000adistortions on the correlation function and compute the full two dimensional\u000acorrelation function \u005cxi(r_p,\u005cpi). From this, we derive the real space\u000acorrelation function, which is well described by $\u005cxi(r) = (r/3.76h^{-1}{\u005crm\u000aMpc})^{-1.66}$ on scales \u005csimlt 20\u005cmpc. The derived correlation functions are\u000afound to be consistent with previous determinations in the literature, and seem\u000ato show more power on large scales than predicted by the standard Cold Dark\u000aMatter (CDM) model. Comparison of the derived \u005cxi(r) with the correlation\u000afunction of optical galaxies implies an optical to IRAS bias ratio of $b_O/b_I\u000a= 1.38\u005cpm 0.12$ on a scale of $\u005csim 8$\u005cmpc . The variances in cubical cells\u000ainferred from \u005cxi(s) appear discrepant with the previously reported results of\u000aEfstathiou et al. (1990).\u000a

V  In this paper, we present quantitative constraints on the scalar field\u000apotential for a general class of inflationary models. (1) We first consider the\u000areconstruction of the inflationary potential for given primordial density\u000afluctuation spectra. Our work differs from previous work on reconstruction in\u000athat we find a semi-analytic solution for the potential for the case of density\u000afluctuations with power-law spectra. In addition, for the case of more general\u000aspectra, we show how constraints on the density fluctuation spectra imply\u000acorresponding constraints on the potential. We present a series of figures\u000awhich show how the shape of the potential depends on the shape of the\u000aperturbation spectrum and on the relative contribution of tensor modes. (2) We\u000ashow that the average ratio $\u005crave$ of the amplitude of tensor perturbations\u000a(gravity wave perturbations) to scalar density perturbations is bounded from\u000aabove: $\u005crave \u005cle$ 1.6. We also show that the ratio $\u005crave$ is proportional to\u000athe change $\u005cDelta \u005cphi$ in the field: $\u005crave \u005capprox 0.42 \u005cDelta \u005cphi/\u005cmp$.\u000aThus, if tensor perturbations are important for the formation of structure,\u000athen the width $\u005cDelta \u005cphi$ must be comparable to the Planck mass. (3) We\u000aconstrain the change $\u005cDelta V$ of the potential and the change $\u005cDelta \u005cphi$\u000aof the inflation field during the portion of inflation when cosmological\u000astructure is produced. We find both upper and lower bounds for $\u005cDelta \u005cphi$\u000aand for $\u005cDelta V$. In addition, these constraints are then used to derive a\u000abound on the scale $\u005cLambda$, which is the scale of the height of the potential\u000a

V  Gamma-ray burst statistics are best explained by a source population at\u000acosmological distances, while spectroscopy and intensity histories of some\u000aindividual bursts imply an origin on Galactic neutron stars. To resolve this\u000ainconsistency I suggest the presence of two populations, one at cosmological\u000adistances and the other Galactic. I build on ideas of Shemi and Piran (1990)\u000aand of M\u005c'esz\u005c'aros and Rees (1993) involving the interaction of fireball\u000adebris with surrounding clouds to explain the observed intensity histories in\u000abursts at cosmological distances. The distances to the Galactic population are\u000aundetermined because they are too few to affect the statistics of intensity and\u000adirection; I explain them as resulting from magnetic reconnection in neutron\u000astar magnetospheres.\u000a

V  We have conducted timing observations of the eclipsing millisecond binary\u000apulsar PSR~B1957+20, extending the span of data on this pulsar to more than\u000afive years. During this time the orbital period of the system has varied by\u000aroughly $\u005cDelta P_b/P_b = 1.6 \u005ctimes 10^{-7}$, changing quadratically with time\u000aand displaying an orbital period second derivative $\u005cddot P_b = (1.43 \u005cpm 0.08)\u000a\u005ctimes 10^{-18}\u005c,$s$^{-1}$. The previous measurement of a large negative\u000aorbital period derivative reflected only the short-term behavior of the system\u000aduring the early observations; the orbital period derivative is now positive\u000aand increasing rapidly. If, as we suspect, the PSR~B1957+20 system is\u000aundergoing quasi-cyclic orbital period variations similar to those found in\u000aother close binaries such as Algol and RS CVn, then the $0.025\u005c,M{_\u005codot}$\u000acompanion to PSR~B1957+20 is most likely non-degenerate, convective, and\u000amagnetically active.\u000a

V  Without assuming any solar models and neutrino flavor conversions, $^8$B\u000aneutrinos seen by the Kamiokande experiment should contribute 2.6$\u005cpm 0.45$ SNU\u000ato the chlorine experiment. When this rate is compared with the total event\u000arate of 2.3$\u005cpm 0.2$ SNU observed by the Homestake experiment which should\u000ainlude a 0.2 SNU contribution from uncertainty-free pep neutrinos, there may\u000astill be a possible evidence that $^7$Be neutrinos are more severely suppressed\u000athan the $^8$B neutrinos with respect to the predictions of standard solar\u000amodels, which cannot be explained by any known astrophysics solution. Given a\u000aKamiokande event rate of larger than 36$\u005c%$ (2$\u005csigma$) of the prediciton of\u000aBahcall and Pinsonneault's standard solar model, variations of standard solar\u000amodels yield minimal rates of 3.6 SNU for the Homestake experiment and 114 SNU\u000afor GALLEX and SAGE. Therefore, variations of standard solar models as\u000asolutions to the solar neutrino problem are so far inconsistent with the\u000aHomestake experiment and only marginally allowed by the gallium experiments. If\u000athe gallium experiments confirm a flux significantly below 114 SNU, it would\u000aimply unconventional physics.\u000a

V  Beginning with a relativistic action principle for the irrotational flow of\u000acollisionless matter, we compute higher order corrections to the Zel'dovich\u000aapproximation by deriving a nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the velocity\u000apotential. It is shown that the velocity of the field may always be derived\u000afrom a potential which however may be a multi-valued function of the space-time\u000acoordinates. In the Newtonian limit, the results are nonlocal because one must\u000asolve the Newton-Poisson equation. By considering the Hamilton-Jacobi equation\u000afor general relativity, we set up gauge-invariant equations which respect\u000acausality. A spatial gradient expansion leads to simple and useful results\u000awhich are local --- they require only derivatives of the initial gravitational\u000apotential.\u000a

V  We present a complete calculation of the cross section for neutralino\u000aannihilation into the two-gluon final state. This channel can be quite\u000aimportant for the phenomenology of neutralino annihilation due to the\u000awell-known helicity suppression of neutralino annihilation into light quarks\u000aand leptons. In addition, we calculate the cross section for annihilation of\u000aneutralinos into a gluon and quark-antiquark pair, and discuss QCD corrections\u000ato the tree-level cross sections for neutralino annihilation into quarks. If\u000athe neutralino is lighter than the top quark, the effect of these results on\u000ahigh-energy neutrino signals from neutralino annihilation in the Sun and in the\u000aEarth can be significant, especially if the neutralino is primarily gaugino. On\u000athe other hand, our results should have little effect on calculations of the\u000acosmological abundance of neutralinos. We also briefly discuss implications for\u000acosmic-ray antiprotons from neutralino annihilation in the galactic halo.\u000a

V  We employ N--body/$3D$ gas dynamic simulations of the formation of galaxy\u000aclusters to determine whether cluster X--ray morphologies can be used as\u000acosmological constraints. Confirming the analytic expectations of Richstone,\u000aLoeb, \u005c& Turner, we demonstrate that cluster evolution is sensitive to the\u000acosmological model in which the clusters form. We further show that\u000aevolutionary differences are echoed in the gross morphological features of the\u000acluster X--ray emission.\u000a  We examine current--epoch X--ray images of models originating from the same\u000ainitial density fields evolved in three different cosmologies: (i) an unbiased,\u000alow density universe with $\u005cOmega_o \u005cse 0.2$; (ii) an unbiased universe\u000adominated by vacuum energy with $\u005cOmega_o \u005cse 0.2$ and $\u005clambda_o \u005cse 0.8$ and\u000a(iii) a biased Einstein--deSitter model ($\u005cOmega \u005cse 1$, $\u005csigma_8=0.59$).\u000aUsing measures of X--ray morphology such as the axial ratio and centroid\u000ashifting, we demonstrate that clusters evolved in the two low $\u005cOmega_o$ models\u000aare much more regular, spherically symmetric, and centrally condensed than\u000aclusters evolved in the Einstein--deSitter model. This morphology--cosmology\u000aconnection, along with the availability of a large body of cluster X--ray\u000aobservations, makes cluster X--ray morphology both a powerful and a practical\u000acosmological discriminant.\u000a

V  We have made a detailed comparison of the results of large N-body simulations\u000awith the analytical description of the merging histories of dark matter halos\u000apresented in Lacey & Cole 1993, which is based on an extension of the Press-\u000aSchechter method (Bond etal 1991,Bower 1991). We find the analytical\u000apredictions for the halo mass function, merger rates and formation times to be\u000aremarkably accurate. The analytical model is however expected to apply for\u000aarbitrary Omega and general power spectra. Dark matter halos were identified in\u000athe simulations using two different methods. For halos selected at mean\u000aoverdensities 100-200, the analytical mass function was found to provide a good\u000afit to the simulations with a collapse threshold close to that predicted by the\u000aspherical collapse model, with a typical error of <30% over a range of 1000 in\u000amass, which is the full dynamic range of our N-body simulations. This was\u000ainsensitive to the type of filtering used. Over a range of 100 - 1000 in mass,\u000athere was also good agreement with the analytical predictions for merger rates,\u000aincluding their dependence on the masses of the two halos involved and the time\u000ainterval being considered, and for formation times, including the dependence on\u000ahalo mass and formation epoch. The analytical Press-Schechter mass function and\u000aits extension to halo lifetimes and merger rates thus provide a very useful\u000adescription of the growth of dark matter halos through hierarchical clustering,\u000aand should providea valuable tool in studies of the formation and evolution of\u000agalaxies and galaxy clusters.\u000a

V  The microscopic dynamics of one-dimensional self-gravitating many-body\u000asystems is studied. We examine two courses of the evolution which has the\u000aisothermal and stationary water-bag distribution as initial conditions. We\u000ainvestigate the evolution of the systems toward thermal equilibrium. It is\u000afound that when the number of degrees of freedom of the system is increased,\u000athe water-bag distribution becomes a quasi-equilibrium, and also the\u000astochasticity of the system reduces. This results suggest that the phase space\u000aof the system is effectively not ergodic and the system with large degreees of\u000afreedom approaches to the near-integrable one.\u000a

V  Global textures are interesting because they are promising candidates for\u000aseeds in the structure formation of the universe. The important configurations\u000aare those who will be able to collapse. The type of configurations that I will\u000aconsider are half knots and true knots. I define a half knot as one that covers\u000amore than a half-$S^3$, and a true knot as a configuration that covers the\u000awhole of $S^3$. Configurations that are half knots will be able to collapse, a\u000anew argument for this collapse criterion is given in this paper. I also give\u000asome critical remarks on the method of using the total winding number as a\u000acriterion for identifying a knot. I propose another more direct method and make\u000ause of it when I estimate the probability for formation of both true and half\u000aknots by numerical simulations.Taking into account the chance of annihilation\u000athe probability for collapse is found to be in the interval $p_{coll} \u005cin\u000a[0.01,0.04]$. In the skyrmion picture of hadrons the investigations of\u000aformation of true knots are important, and some implications of my result on\u000athe predictions of a "topological" theory of baryon production in jets are\u000adiscussed.\u000a

V  We study the quantization of the curved spacetime created by\u000aultrarelativistic particles at Planckian energies. We consider a minisuperspace\u000amodel based on the classical shock wave metric generated by these particles,\u000aand for which the Wheeler - De Witt equation is solved exactly. The wave\u000afunction of the geometry is a Bessel function whose argument is the classical\u000aaction. This allows us to describe not only the semiclassical regime\u000a$(S\u005cto\u005cinfty),$ but also the strong quantum regime $(S\u005cto0).$ We analyze the\u000ainteraction with a scalar field $\u005cphi$ and apply the third quantization\u000aformalism to it. The quantum gravity effects make the system to evolve from a\u000ahighly curved semiclassical geometry (a gravitational wave metric) into a\u000astrongly quantum state represented by a weakly curved geometry (essentially\u000aflat spacetime).\u000a

V  This letter presents results of new high resolution $\u005cOmega=1$ Cold + Hot\u000aDark Matter (CHDM) and Cold Dark Matter (CDM) simulations. Properties of groups\u000ain these simulations reflect the lower small-scale velocities and the greater\u000atendency to form distinct filaments on both small and large scales in CHDM as\u000acompared to CDM. The fraction of galaxies in groups and the median group rms\u000avelocity are found to be powerful discriminators between models. We combine\u000athese two features into a very robust statistic, median group rms velocity\u000a$v_{\u005crm gr}(f_{\u005crm gr})$ as a function of the fraction $f_{\u005crm gr}$ of galaxies\u000ain groups. Using this statistic, we compare ``observed'' simulations to CfA\u000adata in redshift space in a careful and consistent way. We find that CHDM\u000aremains a promising model, with for example $v_{\u005crmgr}(0.45) \u005capprox 125 \u005cpm 25\u000a\u005ckms$ in agreement with the CfA data, while CDM with bias b=1.0\u000a(COBE-compatible) or b=1.5, both giving $v_{\u005crm gr}(0.45) \u005capprox 400 \u005cpm 25\u000a\u005ckms$, can be virtually ruled out. Using median $M/L$, the observed value of\u000a$\u005cOmega$ is $0.10$ (CHDM) to $0.38$ (CDM).\u000a

V  The large-scale bulk flow implied by the measurements of distances to\u000abrightest cluster members within 15,000 km/s by Lauer and Postman has the\u000apotential to put strong constraints on, or to even rule out, various models of\u000alarge-scale structure. Using PM simulations 400$h^{-1}$ Mpc on a side of five\u000acosmological models (Standard CDM, Tilted CDM, HDM, $\u005cOmega = 0.3$ CDM, and\u000aPBI), we present detailed Monte-Carlo simulations of the peculiar velocity\u000adata, which we use to assess the probability that any given model can explain\u000athe data. These models are ruled out at confidence levels ranging from 94\u005c%\u000a(HDM) to 97\u005c% (PBI). However, these results may be affected by the finite size\u000aof the simulation volume. If the observed bulk flow remains unchanged when\u000acalculated using a refined distance indicator with smaller scatter, all these\u000amodels will be ruled out at high confidence levels.\u000a

V  We examine the relationship between the group x-ray luminosity in the 0.3-3.5\u000akeV band and the measured velocity dispersion, and galaxy surface number\u000adensity. We find definite correlations. Richer groups follow the same relation\u000aas rich clusters (cf. Quintana & Melnick 1982) with $L_x \u005cpropto \u005csigma^{4.0\u005cpm\u000a0.6}$, but the relation flattens for lower luminosity systems which have\u000avelocity dispersions below 300 km/s). We suggest that the $L_x-\u005csigma$ relation\u000aarises from a combination of extended cluster emission and emission associated\u000awith individual galaxies. The x-ray emission for the richer groups is dominated\u000aby emission from the intra-group medium, as for the richer clusters; emission\u000afrom the poorer clusters is dominated by less extended emission associated with\u000athe individual group galaxies. This is a corrected version of the paper which\u000aappeared in the Astronomical Journal (February 1994). We include a new version\u000aof the affected figure.\u000a

V  The neutrino emissivity from two and three flavour quark matter is\u000anumerically calculated and compared with Iwamoto's formula. We find that the\u000acalculated emissivity is smaller than Iwamoto's result by orders of magnitude\u000awhen $p_{f}(u)+p_{f}(e)-p_{f}(d(s))$ is comparable with the temperature. We\u000aattribute it to the severe restriction imposed by momentum conservation on the\u000aphase space integral. We obtain an alternate formula for the neutrino\u000aemissivity which is valid when the quarks and electrons are degenerate and\u000a$p_{f}(u)~+~p_{f}(e)~-~p_{f}(d(s))$ is large compared to the temperature.\u000a

V  A sensitive search for 6.7--GHz methanol maser emission has been made towards\u000a10 galaxies that have yielded detectable microwave molecular--line transitions.\u000aThese include several which show OH megamaser or superluminous \u005cwater\u005c/ maser\u000aemission. Within the Galaxy, \u005cmethanol\u005c/ and OH masers often occur in the same\u000astar formation regions and, in most cases, the \u005cmethanol\u005c/ masers have a\u000agreater peak flux density than their OH counterparts. Thus we might expect\u000a\u005cmethanol\u005c/ masers to be associated with extragalactic OH maser sources. We\u000afailed to detect any emission or absorption above our 60--mJy detection limit.\u000aWe conclude that if the physical conditions exist to produce \u005cmethanol\u005c/\u000amegamaser emission, they are incompatible with the conditions which produce OH\u000amegamaser emission.\u000a

V  The energy scale of inflation is of much interest, as it suggests the scale\u000aof grand unified physics and also governs whether cosmological events such as\u000atopological defect formation can occur after inflation. The COBE results are\u000aused to limit the energy scale of inflation at around 60 $e$-foldings from the\u000aend of inflation. An exact dynamical treatment based on the Hamilton-Jacobi\u000aequations is then used to translate this into limits on the energy scale at the\u000aend of inflation. General constraints are given, and then tighter constraints\u000abased on physically motivated assumptions regarding the allowed forms of\u000adensity perturbation and gravitational wave spectra. These are also compared\u000awith the values of familiar models.\u000a

BV surface brightness profiles were constructed out\u000ato R $>$ 40 pc, and single-component King-Michie (KM) models were applied. The\u000atotal cluster luminosity varied from L$_B$ = 2.60 - 2.65 $\u005ctimes 10^6$\u000aL$_B$\u005csol\u005c and L$_V$ = 1.25 - 1.35 $\u005ctimes 10^6$ as the anisotropy radius\u000avaried from infinity to three times the scale radius with the isotropic models\u000aproviding the best agreement with the data. Of the 52 stars with echelle\u000aspectra, a subset of 36 were used to study the cluster dynamics. The KM radial\u000avelocity distributions were fitted to these velocities yielding total cluster\u000amasses of 5.4 - 5.9 $\u005cpm 2.4 \u005ctimes 10^4$ M\u005csol\u005c corresponding to M/L$_B$ =\u000a0.02 $\u005cpm 0.01$ M\u005csol/L$_B$\u005csol\u005c or M/L$_V$ = 0.05 $\u005cpm 0.02$ M\u005csol/L$_V$\u005csol.\u000aA rotational signal in the radial velocities has been detected at the 93\u005c%\u000aconfidence level implying a rotation axis at a position angle of 100\u005cdeg. A\u000avariety of rotating models were fit to the velocity data assuming cluster\u000aellipticities of $\u005cepsilon = 0.1 - 0.3$. These models provided slightly better\u000aagreement with the radial velocity data than the KM models and had masses that\u000awere systematically lower by a few percent. The preferred value for the slope\u000aof a power-law IMF is a relatively shallow, $x = 0.29 \u005cpmm{+0.3}{-0.8}$\u000aassuming the B-band M/L or $x = 0.71 \u005cpmm{+0.2}{-0.4}$ for the V-band.\u000a

V  We exmaine the distribution of hot gas in a standard CDM model of the\u000auniverse using high resolution hydrodynamic simulations. Adopting standard\u000aparameters determined from COBE and light element nucleosynthesis,\u000a$\u005csigma_8=1.05$, $\u005cOmega_b=0.06$ and assuming $h=0.5$, we find the X-ray\u000aemitting clusters, compute the luminosity function at several wavelengths, the\u000atemperature distribution and estimated sizes as well as the evolution of these\u000aquantities with redshift. This standard CDM model, normalized to COBE, produces\u000aapproximately 5 times too much emission from clusters having\u000a$L_x>10^{43}$erg/s, a not unexpected result. If all other parameters were\u000aunchanged, we would expect adequate agreement for $\u005csigma_8=0.6$. This provides\u000aa new and independent argument for lower small scale power than standard CDM at\u000athe $8h^{-1}$Mpc scale. The background radiation field at 1keV due to clusters\u000ain this model is approximately $1/3$ of the observed background which, after\u000acorrection for numerical effects, again indicates approximately 5 times too\u000amuch emission and the appropriateness of $\u005csigma_8=0.6$. If we had used the\u000aobserved ratio of gas to total mass in clusters, rather than basing the mean\u000adensity on light element nucleosynthesis, then the computed luminosity of each\u000acluster would have increased still further, by a factor of approximately ten.\u000aExamining the ratio of gas to total mass in the clusters (which we find to be\u000aanti-biased by a factor of approximately 0.6), normalized to $\u005cOmega_b\u000ah^2=0.015$, and comparing to observations, we conclude, in agreement with S.\u000aWhite, that the cluster observations argue for an open universe.\u000a

V  We derive the effective equations for the out of equilibrium time evolution\u000aof the order parameter and the fluctuations of a scalar field theory in\u000aspatially flat FRW cosmologies.The calculation is performed both to one-loop\u000aand in a non-perturbative, self-consistent Hartree approximation.The method\u000aconsists of evolving an initial functional thermal density matrix in time and\u000ais suitable for studying phase transitions out of equilibrium. The\u000arenormalization aspects are studied in detail and we find that the counterterms\u000adepend on the initial state. We investigate the high temperature expansion and\u000ashow that it breaks down at long times. We also obtain the time evolution of\u000athe initial Boltzmann distribution functions, and argue that to one-loop order\u000aor in the Hartree approximation, the time evolved state is a ``squeezed''\u000astate. We illustrate the departure from thermal equilibrium by numerically\u000astudying the case of a free massive scalar field in de Sitter and radiation\u000adominated cosmologies. It is found that a suitably defined non-equilibrium\u000aentropy per mode increases linearly with comoving time in a de Sitter\u000acosmology, whereas it is {\u005cit not} a monotonically increasing function in the\u000aradiation dominated case.\u000a

V  We review mechanisms for the transport of angular momentum in accretion disks\u000athat are low mass, in the sense that the gravitational forces produced by the\u000amaterial in these disks has a negligible effect on disk dynamics. There is no\u000aestablished consensus on how this transport takes place. We note that for\u000aphenomenological reasons the traditional $\u005calpha$ model is probably not a good\u000adescription of real disks. We discuss models in which angular momentum\u000atransport is driven by shocks, and by magnetic field instabilities. The latter\u000ais more promising, but requires a dynamo. We note that the direction of angular\u000amomentum transport due to convection in a conducting disk is not known as\u000acompeting mechanisms are at work. We briefly discuss a number of possible\u000adynamo mechanisms, and their problems. We then give a detailed exposition of\u000athe internal wave driven dynamo model, in which internal waves excited at large\u000aradii drive an $\u005calpha-\u005cOmega$ dynamo.\u000a

V  This paper covers the material of our two talks. We describe a series of\u000aprojects based upon perturbative expansions to follow the gravitational\u000aevolution of the one point probability distribution functions (PDFs) for the\u000adensity contrast field and for the divergence of the corresponding velocity\u000afield. The Edgeworth expansion greatly simplifies the problem. Indeed, the PDF\u000acan be described through several low order moments, with the first non-trivial\u000acontribution coming from the skewness, or third moment. Gaussian initial\u000aconditions imply that the skewness of the smoothed density field is\u000aproportional to the square of the variance. The constant of proportionality is\u000athen a function of the logarithmic slope of the variance versus scale, and is\u000aotherwise independent of scale. This constant is also practically independent\u000aof the density parameter $\u005cOmega$, and has very nearly the same value when\u000adistances are estimated by redshifts. To show the latter property, we also\u000abriefly discuss our Lagrangian approach to perturbation theory. Finally, the\u000aobserved skewness does depend, of course, on the relation between the\u000adistribution of light and mass; we describe the case of local biasing. For the\u000adivergence of the velocity field, the skewness of its PDF is also proportional\u000ato the square of its variance, but the ratio now strongly depends on the value\u000aof $\u005cOmega$. This offers a new method to determine the density parameter which\u000adoes not involve comparisons\u000a

V  We have obtained 12CO and 13CO J=1-0 observations of the nearby spiral galaxy\u000aM33 to try to resolve the long-standing discrepancy between 12CO/13CO line\u000aratios measured in Galactic giant molecular clouds and external galaxies.\u000aInterferometer maps of the molecular cloud MC20 give a 12CO/13CO line ratio of\u000a7.5+/-2.1, which agrees reasonably well with the line ratio measured in\u000aGalactic giant molecular clouds. In contrast, the 12CO/13CO line ratio obtained\u000afrom single dish data is 10.0+/-0.9, significantly higher than Galactic values\u000abut in good agreement with line ratios measured in other galaxies. The\u000ainterferometer map of MC20 reveals that the cloud has similar spatial and\u000avelocity extents in the two lines, and thus the high single dish line ratio\u000acannot be due to different filling factors in the two lines. In addition, the\u000asingle dish data show no evidence for significant variations in the line ratio\u000awith metallicity, which eliminates abundance changes as the explanation for the\u000ahigh single dish line ratio. We conclude that the high 12CO/13CO line ratio s\u000aobserved in M33, and in the disks of spiral galaxies in general, are due to the\u000apresence of a population of diffuse molecular clouds. The lower limit to the\u000afraction of the total 12CO emission from M33 that originates in the diffuse\u000aclouds is 30+/-30%, while the upper limit is ~60%.\u000a

V  Long lived modes of elliptical galaxies can exist {\u005cit \u005c`a la} van Kampen.\u000aSpecific systems may possess long lived oscillations which Landau damp on time\u000ascales longer than a Hubble time. Some physical processes such as a close\u000aencounter, tidal forces from a cluster or an orbiting satellite could\u000apreferentially excite a coherent mode. These may relate to the observed faint\u000astructure in elliptical galaxies such as shells and ripples. Their detection in\u000aprojected phase space would ultimately provide a detailed probe of the\u000aunderlying potential. I give an overview of linear perturbations to stationary\u000asolutions of the Vlasov equation, including a discretized Hermite polynomial\u000aexpansion which explicitly demonstrates completeness and orthogonality of\u000asolutions. Some exact solutions are shown, which implies the feasibility of\u000asuch a procedure and suggest future fully numerical studies.\u000a

V  Coalescing binaries in distant galaxies are one of the most promising sources\u000aof gravitational waves detectable by the LIGO project.$^{[1-5]}$ They are also\u000aa copious source of neutrinos,$^{[1]}$ however these neutrino pulses are far\u000atoo weak to be detected on earth. Several years ago Eichler \u005cetal$\u005c,$$^{[6]}$\u000asuggested that they are also sources of $\u005cgamma$-ray bursts (GRBs). Recently it\u000awas found$^{[7]}$ that GRBs are likely to be cosmological in origin, and\u000acoalescing binary systems$^{[6,8-11]}$ are probably the most promising\u000acosmological sources. The current estimates of the burst and LIGO rates from a\u000acosmologically distributed population are based on the systems observed in our\u000agalaxy.$^{[12-14]}$ These estimates are based on only three binarys so there\u000aare large statistical uncertainties in the coalescence rate. If we accept the\u000acosmological/coalescing binary hypothesis for GRBs, then we get a more accurate\u000aestimate of the rate at which binaries coalesce and hence of the predicted LIGO\u000asignal. The association between GRBs and binaries can significantly improve the\u000aperformance of LIGO. The detection of gravitational radiation from a GRB source\u000anot only confirms the coalescing binary model, but it will also provide\u000ainformation on the geometry and energy generation mechanism of the burst.\u000a

We show that given a large enough asymmetry, the\u000abaryon number will be preserved down to low temperatures even if B - L = 0,\u000abecause the baryon number carrying scalars form bose condensates that give the\u000aW a mass. We derive the conditions on the condensate needed to suppress\u000aelectroweak sphaleron interactions which would otherwise drive the baryon\u000aasymmetry to zero when B - L = 0.\u000a

V  Three colour photometry on CCD frames in the Special Area SpA23 provides a\u000adeep probe of the galactic disc in a low absorption window towards the\u000aanticenter. Magnitudes to better than 10% at V = 25 and B-V colour down to V =\u000a23 have been obtained. These new data, used in combination with lower magnitude\u000aphotographic data in a wider field, give a strong evidence that the galactic\u000adensity scale length is rather short (2.5 kpc) and drops abruptly beyond 6 kpc.\u000a

Taking this into account,\u000atogether with the fact that recent work indicates that the masses of neutron\u000astar crusts are considerably smaller than previously estimated, we find\u000aneutrino pair bremsstrahlung to be much less important for the thermal\u000aevolution of neutron stars than earlier calculations suggested.\u000a

V  We examine the nature of galaxy clustering in redshift space using a method\u000abased on an expansion of the galaxian density field in Spherical Harmonics and\u000alinear theory. We derive a compact and self-consistent expression for the\u000adistortion when applied to flux limited redshift surveys. The amplitude of the\u000adistortion is controlled by the combination of the density and bias parameters,\u000a$\u005cbeta\u005cequiv\u005cOmega_\u005ccirc^{0.6}/b$ as well as the shape of the real space power\u000aspectrum, $P(k)$ (characterized by a shape parameter $\u005cGamma$), and its\u000anormalization, $\u005csigma_8$; we exploit this fact to derive a maximum likelihood\u000aestimator for $\u005cbeta$, $\u005cGamma$, and $\u005csigma_8$. We check our formalism using\u000a$N$-body simulations and demonstrate it provides an unbiased estimate of\u000a$\u005cbeta$ when the amplitude and shape of the galaxy power spectrum is known.\u000aApplication of the technique to the 1.2 Jy \u005ciras\u005c redshift survey yields $\u005cbeta\u000a=0.94\u005cpm 0.17$ and $\u005cGamma=0.17\u005cpm0.05$ (1-$\u005csigma$) when $\u005csigma_8$ is held\u000afixed at its best value as determined from the real space correlation function.\u000aAllowing $\u005csigma_8$ to be a free parameter, we find $\u005cbeta=0.47\u005cpm 0.25$,\u000a$\u005cGamma=0.15\u005cpm0.05$, and $\u005csigma_8=0.81\u005cpm0.06$.\u000a

V  Using Peebles' least action principle, we determine trajectories for the\u000agalaxies in the Local Group and the more massive galaxies in the Local\u000aNeighbourhood. We deduce the resulting angular momentum for the whole of the\u000aLocal Group and study the tidal force acting on the Local Group and its\u000agalaxies. Although Andromeda and the Milky Way dominate the tidal force acting\u000aon each other during the present epoch, we show that there is a transition time\u000aat $z\u005capprox 1$ before which the tidal force is dominated by galaxies outside\u000athe Local Group in each case. This shows that the Local Group can not be\u000aconsidered as an isolated system as far as the tidal forces are concerned. We\u000aintegrate the tidal torques acting on the Milky Way and Andromeda and derive\u000atheir spin angular momenta, obtaining results which are comparable with\u000aobservation.\u000a

V  The technibaryon constitutes a possible dark matter candidate. Such a\u000aparticle with electroweak quantum numbers is already nearly ruled out as the\u000adominant component of the galactic dark matter by nuclear recoil experiments.\u000aHere, the scattering of singlet technibaryons, without electroweak quantum\u000anumbers, is considered. For scalar technibaryons the most important interaction\u000ais the charge radius. The scattering rates are typically of order $10^{-4}$ (kg\u000akeV day)$^{-1}$ for a technicolor scale of 1 TeV. For fermionic technibaryons\u000athe most important interaction is the magnetic dipole moment. The scattering\u000arates in this case are considerably larger, typically between $10^{-1}$ and 1\u000a(kg keV day)$^{-1}$, depending on the detector material. Rates this large may\u000abe detectable in the next generation of nuclear recoil experiments. Such\u000aexperiments will also be sensitive to quite small technibaryon electric dipole\u000amoments.\u000a

V  We analyze stability conditions of "Maclaurin flows" (self-gravitating,\u000abarotropic, two dimensional, stationary streams moving in closed loops around a\u000apoint) by minimizing their energy, subject to fixing all the constants of the\u000amotion including mass and circulations. Necessary and sufficient conditions of\u000astability are obtained when gyroscopic terms in the perturbed Lagrangian are\u000azero. To illustrate and check the properties of this new energy principle, we\u000ahave calculated the stability limits of an ordinary Maclaurin disk whose\u000adynamical stability limits are known. Perturbations are in the plane of the\u000adisk. We find all necessary and sufficient conditions of stability for single\u000amode symmetrical or antisymmetrical perturbations. The limits of stability are\u000aidentical with those given by a dynamical analysis. Regarding mixed types of\u000aperturbations the maximally constrained energy principle give for some the\u000anecessary and sufficient condition of stability, for others only sufficient\u000aconditions of stability. The application of the new energy principle to\u000aMaclaurin disks shows the method to be as powerful as the method of dynamical\u000aperturbations.\u000a

We introduce a "world data\u000aset" of UHE cosmic rays by comparing the data of various experiments,\u000aextracting relative systematic errors in the energy derivation and averaging\u000aover energy bins. Since the contribution of FR-II hot spots is expected to be\u000adominated by protons, we can also compare it to the recent experimental results\u000afor the proton component of cosmic rays between 0.1 and 1 EeV from both the\u000aFly's Eye and the Akeno airshower detector (Gaisser et al. 1993, Phys Rev D in\u000apress, and Stanev et al. 1992, A&A submitted). The result is striking: Our\u000aprediction for energies below 1 EeV fits very well to the data for the proton\u000acomponent, while explaining the total flux at highest energies as well. The\u000aresult is consistent with the expectation of a galactic component, consisting\u000aof heavy nuclei only, that has a slope of about -3.1 and cuts off at 5 EeV, as\u000apredicted by Biermann 1993 (A&A in press, BB paper astro-ph/9301008)\u000a

V  We present UBVI surface photometry of a sample of low surface brightness\u000a(LSB) disk galaxies. LSB disk galaxies are fairly well described as exponential\u000adisks with no preferred value for either scale length, central surface\u000abrightness, or rotational velocity. Indeed, the distribution of scale lengths\u000ais indistinguishable from that of high surface brightness spirals, indicating\u000athat dynamically similar galaxies (e.g., those with comparable Rv^2) exist over\u000aa large range in surface density.\u000a  These LSB galaxies are strikingly blue. The complete lack of correlation\u000abetween central surface brightness and color rules out any fading scenario.\u000aSimilarly, the oxygen abundances inferred from HII region spectra are\u000auncorrelated with color so the low metallicities are not the primary cause of\u000athe blue colors. While these are difficult to interpret in the absence of\u000asignificant star formation, the most plausible scenario is a stellar population\u000awith a young mean age stemming from late formation and subsequent slow\u000aevolution.\u000a  These properties suggest that LSB disks formed from low initial overdensities\u000awith correspondingly late collapse times.\u000a

V  High energy particles are produced by the annihilation of dark matter\u000aparticles in our galaxy. These are presently searched for using balloon-borne\u000aantiproton and positron detectors and large area, deep underground neutrino\u000atelescopes. Dark matter particles, trapped inside the sun, are an abundant\u000asource of such neutrinos.\u000a  From both the cosmological and particle physics points of view the lightest,\u000astable supersymmetric particle or neutralino is arguably the leading dark\u000amatter candidate. Its mass is bracketed by a minimum value of order a few tens\u000aof GeV, determined from unsuccessful accelerator searches, and a maximum value\u000aof order 1~TeV imposed by particle physics as well as cosmological\u000aconstraints. Back-of-the-envelope calculations are sufficient to demonstrate\u000ahow present neutrino telescopes are competitive with existing and future\u000aparticle colliders such as the LHC in the search for supersymmetry. We\u000aemphasize that a $1\u005c,\u005crm km^2$ area is the natural scale for a future\u000ainstrument capable of probing the full GeV--TeV neutralino mass range by\u000asearching for high energy neutrinos produced by their annihilation in the sun.\u000a

V  We derive an optimal linear filter to suppress the noise from the COBE DMR\u000asky maps for a given power spectrum. We then apply the filter to the first-year\u000aDMR data, after removing pixels within $20^\u005ccirc$ of the Galactic plane from\u000athe data. The filtered data have uncertainties 12 times smaller than the noise\u000alevel of the raw data. We use the formalism of constrained realizations of\u000aGaussian random fields to assess the uncertainty in the filtered sky maps. In\u000aaddition to improving the signal-to-noise ratio of the map as a whole, these\u000atechniques allow us to recover some information about the CMB anisotropy in the\u000amissing Galactic plane region. From these maps we are able to determine which\u000ahot and cold spots in the data are statistically significant, and which may\u000ahave been produced by noise. In addition, the filtered maps can be used for\u000acomparison with other experiments on similar angular scales.\u000a

V  The distribution of dark matter around galactic or cluster halos has usually\u000abeen assumed to be approximately isothermal with a non-zero core radius, which\u000ais expected to be of the order of the size of the visible matter distribution.\u000aRecently, the possibility has been raised that dark matter halos might be\u000asingular in the sense that the dark matter density $\u005crho$ could increase\u000amonotonically with radius $r$ down to a very small distance from the center of\u000agalaxies or clusters. Such central cusps in the dark matter density could lead\u000ato a high flux of gamma rays from WIMP dark matter annihilation. Here we\u000aanalyze two possibilities that have been discussed in the literature, $\u005crho\u000a\u005cpropto r^{-n}$ with $n \u005capprox 1\u005c {\u005crm or}\u005c 2$, and point out that such\u000adensity profiles are excluded by gravitional lensing analyses on cluster scales\u000aand by the rotation curves of gas-rich, halo-dominated dwarf spirals on small\u000ascales. We also point out that if spiral galaxies form by gas infall inside\u000adark matter halos, as they are expected to do in any hierarchical clustering\u000amodel, such profiles almost always lead to falling rotation curves after\u000ainfall, contrary to observations.\u000a

V  Abbreviated abstract of an invited talk at the International Cosmic Ray\u000aConference in Calgary, July 1993: The results from the COBE satellite are in\u000aclose agreement with the predictions of the standard hot Big Bang model,\u000asuggesting that the Universe was once hot, dense and isothermal, giving a\u000abackground radiation spectrum that is close to a perfect blackbody. The\u000aspectrum observed by the FIRAS instrument places strong limits on events and\u000ascenarios occurring later than 1 year after the Big Bang. The observation of\u000aintrinsic anisotropy of the microwave background by the DMR instrument provides\u000aa measurement of the magnitude of the gravitational potential fluctuations that\u000aexisted at decoupling. These potential perturbations were either produced in an\u000ainflationary epoch, or else they are initial conditions dating from t = 0. The\u000aangular power spectrum of dT is compatible with the inflationary scenario. The\u000aobserved amplitude of dT can be used to restrict theories of the fundamental\u000astructure of matter on micro-physical scales and at energies higher than that\u000aof the most energetic cosmic rays. The DIRBE instrument will provide greatly\u000aimproved data on extragalactic IR backgrounds after the strong foreground\u000aemission is subtracted.\u000a

V  Radio continuum emission has been detected from a planetary nebula in the\u000aLarge Magellanic Cloud: this is the first radio continuum detection for any\u000aplanetary nebula outside our galaxy. The radio flux density is a factor of two\u000alower than predicted from the \u005chbeta\u005c flux. This could be due either to a\u000atwo-component morphology or to a stellar contribution to the \u005chbeta\u005c emission.\u000aWe have modeled the optical and infrared spectrum using the photo-ionisation\u000acode Cloudy: a very good fit is obtained if we assume the nebula is carbon\u000arich. The derived diameter implies an evolutionary age of the nebula of\u000a$<1000\u005cyr$, similar to what is derived from the IRAS colours alone. The central\u000astar, which is of [WC] type, has a much higher stellar temperature than\u000aGalactic [WC] stars showing similar circumstellar IRAS colours. An explanation\u000acould be that the expansion velocity of the nebula is lower than those of its\u000agalactic counterparts. This radio detection indicates that accurate nebular\u000aluminosities could be determined from their radio emission for many LMC\u000aplanetary nebulae.\u000a

V  We present the results of a neutral hydrogen survey conducted with the Green\u000aBank 140-foot radio telescope of 47 northern objects in the polar-ring galaxy\u000aatlas of Whitmore \u005cetal\u005c (1990). We detected 39 of these above our detection\u000alimit of 1.7 \u005chbox{Jy\u005cCDOT\u005cKMS}; the average measured flux of 21 Jy\u005cCDOT\u005cKMS\u005c\u000acorresponds to an average neutral hydrogen mass of $\u005crm 5.3 \u005ctimes 10^9$ \u005cMSUN\u000afor a Hubble constant of $\u005crm H_0 = 75$ \u005cKMS \u005c Mpc$^{-1}$. For the polar-ring\u000agalaxies in our sample that have also been observed with radio arrays, we find\u000athat the 21\u005cAMIN\u005c (FWHM) Green Bank beam often includes much more flux than\u000afound by the synthesis instruments for the polar rings alone; some of these\u000agalaxies are known to have gas-rich companions. We compare the neutral hydrogen\u000acontent of the sample to the blue luminosity and IRAS fluxes. The \u005cHI-to-blue-\u000alight ratios of the confirmed and probable polar rings are around unity in\u000asolar units, indicating that polar ring galaxies (or their environments) are as\u000agas-rich as typical irregular galaxies. For their blue luminosity, the\u000aconfirmed polar rings are underluminous in the far-infrared, as compared with\u000athe rest of the sample. They are also FIR-underluminous for their \u005cHI\u005c masses,\u000awhich suggests that most of the gas in the ring may be in stable orbits, rather\u000athan flowing inward to trigger star formation in the central galaxy. The more\u000adisordered class of `related objects,' which includes a number of obvious\u000amergers, is highly luminous in the far-infrared.\u000a

V  We discuss a method for a model independent reconstruction of the CMB\u000atemperature fluctuation power spectrum on small and intermediate scales that is\u000ageared to individual experiments. The importance of off-diagonal correlations\u000afor determining the shape of the power spectrum is emphasized and some examples\u000aof a reconstruction method are given. By using this method to ``map'' the power\u000aspectrum on the scales to which they are sensitive several experiments could be\u000acombined to map out the full power spectrum, and test consistency of observed\u000afeatures. For example we find that the GUM scan of the 3rd flight of the MAX\u000aexperiment prefers a positive slope to the power spectrum near $\u005cell\u005csimeq160$,\u000awhich provides weak evidence for the presence of a Doppler peak.\u000a

V  We consider the coupled evolution of density, (scalar) metric and dilaton\u000aperturbations in the transition from a ``stringy" phase of growing curvature\u000aand gravitational coupling to the standard radiation-dominated cosmology. We\u000ashow that dilaton production, with a spectrum tilted towards large frequencies,\u000aemerges as a general property of this scenario. We discuss the\u000aframe-independence of the dilaton spectrum and of the inflationary properties\u000aof the metric background by using, as model of source, a pressureless gas of\u000aweakly interacting strings, which is shown to provide an approximate but\u000aconsistent solution to the full system of background equations and string\u000aequations of motion. We combine various cosmological bounds on a growing\u000adilaton spectrum with the bound on the dilaton mass obtained from tests of the\u000aequivalence principle, and we find allowed windows compatible with a universe\u000apresently dominated by a relic background of dilatonic dark matter.\u000a

V  MAPPIT is an optical interferometer installed at the coude focus of the 3.9-m\u000aAnglo-Australian Telescope. The instrument combines non-redundant masking with\u000awavelength dispersion and is able to record fringes simultaneously over a wide\u000abandwidth. For typical observations centred near 600 nm, the bandwidth is 55 nm\u000aand the spectral resolution is 3 nm. This paper describes the instrument and\u000athe data processing methods and presents some results. We find the star sigma\u000aSgr to be a close binary; the system is only partially resolved, with a\u000aseparation of (11.5 +/- 2) milliarcsec (assuming the components to have equal\u000amagnitudes). We also give angular diameter measurements of two red giant stars,\u000aalpha Sco and beta Gru. The observations of beta Gru (spectral type M5 III)\u000aresolve the star for the first time and give an equivalent uniform-disk\u000adiameter of (27 +/- 3) milliarcsec.\u000a

V  The average flux decrement shortward the Ly$_{\u005calpha}$ emission, due to the\u000awell-known ``forest'' of absorptions, has been measured in the spectra of 8\u000aquasars. Quasi-simultaneous optical and IUE observations of the two low\u000aredshift quasars PKS 0637--75 (z=0.654) and MC 1104+16 (z=0.632) have been\u000acarried out, obtaining relatively high S/N, spectrophotometrically calibrated\u000adata on their energy distribution from the rest frame H$_{\u005cbeta}$ to the Lyman\u000acontinuum. Six more quasars in the redshift range 2.5-3.4 have been observed in\u000athe optical domain. For all the quasars the ``intrinsic'' continuum slope and\u000anormalization have been estimated longward the Ly$_{\u005calpha}$ emission and\u000aextrapolated towards the Lyman continuum to measure the average depressions,\u000awhich have been compared with the model statistics of the Ly$_{\u005calpha}$ clouds.\u000aWhen all the known classes of absorbers are taken into account with plausible\u000avalues for their equivalent width distribution and evolution, a good agreement\u000ais obtained with the observations. The results for the observed continuum\u000adecrement at $z \u005csim 0.65$ are identical to those predicted by the evolution\u000awith redshift of the number of Ly$_{\u005calpha}$ forest systems including the HST\u000adata and within $2\u005csigma$ of the predicted value using the ``standard''\u000aLy$_{\u005calpha}$ evolution (as determined only at high z).\u000a

V  ( to appear in: Proceedings of the Nishonomiya Yukawa Memorial Symposium\u000aEdited by M. Sasaki) There are several models for generating fluctuations in an\u000aopen universe that are compatible with the microwave background fluctuations\u000adetected by COBE {\u005cit and} observations of large scale structure. Topological\u000adefects, such as strings and textures, appear to be more successful in a\u000alow-$\u005cOmega$ model than in an $\u005cOmega = 1$ model. These models predict that the\u000acosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations are non-Gaussian with\u000adistinctive signatures that may lead to their confirmation. If there exists a\u000amechanism for generating scale invariant mass fluctuations, $(\u005cdelta M/M)^2\u000a\u005cpropto M^{-4/3}$, then these models are also compatible with COBE. Both models\u000apredict mass fluctuations on the 8/h Mpc scale, $\u005csigma_8$, $\u005csim 0.5 - 1$ for\u000a$\u005cOmega h \u005csim 0.2 - 0.3$. A variety of observations of large-scale structure,\u000aclusters and galaxies, as well as the age problem, suggest that the\u000alow-$\u005cOmega$ models are attractive.\u000a

V  We investigate the evolution of the skewness of the distribution of density\u000afluctuations in CDM models with both Gaussian and non--Gaussian initial\u000afluctuations. We show that the method proposed by Coles \u005c& Frenk (1991), which\u000auses the skewness of galaxy counts to test the hypothesis of Gaussian\u000aprimordial density fluctuations, is a potentially powerful probe of initial\u000aconditions. As expected, the mass distribution in models with initially\u000anon--Gaussian fluctuations shows systematic departures from the Gaussian\u000abehaviour on intermediate to large scales. We investigate the effect of\u000apeculiar velocity distortions and normalisation upon the relationship between\u000askewness and variance. These effects are generally small for the models we\u000aconsider. Comparing our results to the QDOT measurements of the skewness, we\u000afind that our initially positive--skew models are clearly excluded by this\u000aanalysis, but the available data do not rule out the negative--skew models.\u000a

V  Orbits in triaxial ellipsoidal potentials precess about either the major or\u000aminor axis of the ellipsoid. In standard perturbation theory it can be shown\u000athat a circular orbit will precess about the minor axis if its angular momentum\u000avector lies in a region bounded by two great circles which pass through the\u000aintermediate axis and which are inclined with minimum separation $i_T$ from the\u000aminor axis. We test the accuracy of the standard formula for $i_T$ by\u000aperforming orbit integrations to determine $i_S$, the simulated turnover angle\u000acorresponding to $i_T$. We reach two principal conclusions: (i) $i_S$ is\u000ausually greater than $i_T$, by as much as 12 degrees even for moderate\u000atriaxialities, $A/1.2<B<C/0.8$. This reduces the expected frequency of polar\u000arings. (ii) $i_S$ is not a single, well-defined number but can vary by a few\u000adegrees depending upon the initial phase of the orbit. This means that there is\u000aa reasonable probability for capture of gas onto orbits which precess about\u000aboth axes. Interactions can then lead to substantial loss of angular momentum\u000aand subsequent infall to the galactic centre.\u000a

V  I develop a theory to account for the cosmic ray spectrum. The essential\u000aassumption is that, due to fast convective motions, the free mean path\u000aperpendicular to the magnetic field is independent of energy and has the scale\u000aof the thickness of the shocked layer. I use the basic concept, that the\u000aenergetic Cosmic Ray particles are accelerated in a Supernova shock that\u000atravels down a stellar wind. Discussion gives a knee energy expression, which\u000aleads to a suggestion on the physical origin of the mechanical energy of\u000aSupernova explosions, the gravitational potential energy mediated by the\u000aangular momentum and the magnetic field. The spectrum below the knee is\u000a$E^{-8/3}$. At the knee the particles segregate with particle energy according\u000ato their charge. The spectrum beyond the knee is very close to $E^{-3}$. The\u000atheory has been checked successfully against air shower data in two subsequent\u000apapers (Stanev, Biermann, Gaisser, 1992 preprint; Rachen, Stanev, Biermann,\u000a1992 preprint).\u000a

V  The cosmological fluid equations are used to study the nonlinear mode\u000acoupling of density fluctuations. We find that for realistic cosmological\u000aspectra there is a significant contribution to the nonlinear evolution on\u000ascales of interest to large-scale structure from the long-wave part of the\u000ainitial spectrum. A consequence of this mode coupling is that at high redshift,\u000a$z$, the nonlinear scale [defined by $\u005csigma(z)=1$] can be significantly larger\u000athan a linear extrapolation would indicate. For the standard CDM spectrum with\u000aa $\u005csigma_8=1$ normalization the mass corresponding to the nonlinear scale at\u000a$z=20, 10, 5$ is about $100, 10, 3$ times (respectively) larger than the\u000alinearly extrapolated value. We also investigate the possibility of divergent\u000acontributions to the density field from long-wave modes if the spectral index\u000aof the power spectrum $\u005c n<-1$. Using an approximate non-perturbative approach\u000awe find that for $n>-3\u005c,$ the divergent contribution appears only in the phase.\u000aThis can be related to the large-scale bulk velocity, and clarifies previous\u000aresults from N-body simulations.\u000a

V  The first two years of COBE DMR observations of the CMB anisotropy are\u000aanalyzed and compared with our previously published first year results. The\u000aresults are consistent, but the addition of the second year of data increases\u000athe precision and accuracy of the detected CMB temperature fluctuations. The\u000atwo-year 53 GHz data are characterized by RMS temperature fluctuations of\u000aDT=44+/-7 uK at 7 degrees and DT=30.5+/-2.7 uK at 10 degrees angular\u000aresolution. The 53X90 GHz cross-correlation amplitude at zero lag is\u000aC(0)^{1/2}=36+/-5 uK (68%CL) for the unsmoothed 7 degree DMR data. A likelihood\u000aanalysis of the cross correlation function, including the quadrupole\u000aanisotropy, gives a most likely quadrupole-normalized amplitude\u000aQ_{rms-PS}=12.4^{+5.2}_{-3.3} uK (68% CL) and a spectral index\u000an=1.59^{+0.49}_{-0.55} for a power law model of initial density fluctuations,\u000aP(k)~k^n. With n fixed to 1.0 the most likely amplitude is 17.4 +/-1.5 uK (68%\u000aCL). Excluding the quadrupole anisotropy we find Q_{rms-PS}= 16.0^{+7.5}_{-5.2}\u000auK (68% CL), n=1.21^{+0.60}_{-0.55}, and, with n fixed to 1.0 the most likely\u000aamplitude is 18.2+/-1.6 uK (68% CL). Monte Carlo simulations indicate that\u000athese derived estimates of n may be biased by ~+0.3 (with the observed low\u000avalue of the quadrupole included in the analysis) and {}~+0.1 (with the\u000aquadrupole excluded). Thus the most likely bias-corrected estimate of n is\u000abetween 1.1 and 1.3. Our best estimate of the dipole from the two-year DMR data\u000ais 3.363+/-0.024 mK towards Galactic coordinates (l,b)= (264.4+/-0.2 degrees,\u000a+48.1+/-0.4 degrees), and our best estimate of the RMS quadrupole amplitude in\u000aour sky is 6+/-3 uK.\u000a

V  By a combination of analytical and numerical methods, the density profile of\u000aa momentarily at rest spherical star is varied, and the corresponding response\u000ain the area of the spherical shells is monitored. It is shown that the inner\u000aapparent horizon (if it exists) must lie within or at most on the star's\u000asurface, while no such restriction is found for the outer apparent horizon.\u000aHowever, an apparent horizon lying in the vacuum region will always have non\u000avanishing area, as long as the ADM mass of the system is non zero. Furthermore\u000afor density profiles not decreasing inwards, it appears that all spherical\u000atrapped surfaces lie on a thick spherical shell. Finally for a uniform density\u000astar a simple criterion is found, relating density and proper radius that\u000aguarantees the presence or absence of trapped regions.\u000a

V  Models for structure formation attempt to predict the power spectrum of\u000adensity perturbations in the present universe from the initial power spectrum\u000aand the nature of dark matter. Observational constraints on the power spectrum\u000aat different scales in the present epoch can, therefore, be used to eliminate\u000a(or choose between) different theoretical models. Such a comparison is fairly\u000aeasy at large scales (at which linear theory is valid), and one can use\u000aobservations like the MBR anisotropy, large scale steaming motions etc to\u000aconstrain the models. But to discriminate between the models effectivley, it is\u000anecessay to constrain the power spectrum at small scales. The most reliable\u000aconstraints on the power spectra at small scales come from the predicted\u000aabundance of bound systems which can be estimated reasonably accurately using\u000aPress-Schecter (or similar) methods$^1$. In the past, this method has been used\u000ain conjunction with the quasar abundance$^{2-4}$ and cluster abundance$^{5-7}$.\u000aWe show here that the abundance of damped lyman alpha systems (DLAS,\u000ahereafter), provides a far stronger constraint on the models for structure\u000aformation. Models with a mixture of hot and cold dark matter $^{8-11}$ (which\u000aare consistent with large scale observations) are strongly ruled out by the\u000aDLAS constraints while models with cosmological constant $^{12}$ are marginally\u000ainconsistent. It is also possible to combine the constraints from the abundance\u000aof clusters, DLAS and QSO's to obtain model-independent bounds on the power\u000aspectrum at the nonlinear scales. These bounds are to be respected by any\u000aviable model for structure formation.\u000a

V  Using numerical simulations, we investigate the large-scale gravitational\u000aclustering in a flat universe dominated by cold plus hot dark matter (i.e.,\u000a$\u005cOmega_0=\u005cocdm+\u005cohdm+\u005cobaryon=1$). Primordial density fluctuation spectrum is\u000ataken to have the Zel'dovich-Harrison form. Three models are studied, with\u000aModel I having $\u005cocdm=0.69$, $\u005cobaryon=0.01$, and $\u005cohdm=0.30$ in one flavor of\u000aneutrinos; Model II having $\u005cocdm=0.60$, $\u005cobaryon=0.10$, and $\u005cohdm=0.30$ in\u000aone flavor of neutrinos; Model III having $\u005cocdm=0.69$, $\u005cobaryon=0.01$, and\u000a$\u005cohdm=0.30$ in three flavors of neutrinos. The initial density spectra are\u000anormalized by the COBE quadrupole measurement, and galaxies are identified from\u000athe peaks of initial density fields above a certain threshold chosen, to match\u000athe observed two-point correlation on scales $\u005cls 10\u005cmpc$. Thus the clustering\u000aproperties of both the mass and the galaxies are completely specified. The\u000abiasing parameter (for the `galaxies') determined in this way is $b_g\u005capprox\u000a1.2$ for Model I, 1.5 for Model II and 1.6 for Model III. The clustering and\u000amotions of the simulated `galaxies' are compared with recent observations. The\u000aspatial distributions of galaxies in the hybrid models are very frothy;\u000afilaments, sheets, voids etc. of sizes 10 -- 50$\u005cmpc$ are frequently seen in\u000athe simulations.\u000a

V  The idea that Fanaroff-Riley Class~I Radio Galaxies contain core jets with\u000aLorentz factors of the order of a few and are the parent population for BL~Lac\u000aObjects is examined, with particular reference to the data on two FRI Radio\u000aGalaxies, NGC~315 and NGC~6251. Conservation laws for an entraining\u000arelativistic jet are derived and are used to determine a relationship between\u000aMach number and velocity for initially relativistic jets. One immediate\u000aconsequence of this relationship is that, if an initially relativistic jet is\u000adecelerated to a transonic Mach number between, say 0.5 and 1.5, then its\u000avelocity at this point is between 0.3 and 0.7 times the speed of light.\u000aAnalysis of the milliarcsecond and arcsecond data on NGC~315 and NGC~6251 shows\u000athat the Lorentz factors of the core jets in these galaxies can be as high as\u000a2-4 provided that the jet pressures are not much more than an order of\u000amagnitude higher than the minimum pressures. Such Lorentz factors are more\u000aplausible if the jets are inclined at $\u005csim 30$ degrees to the line of sight,\u000aalthough larger angles would also be possible. For core Lorentz factors in the\u000arange 2-4, the jets are mildly relativistic on the large scale and their\u000avelocities are consistent with the jet brightness asymmetries being caused by\u000aDoppler beaming. The Lorentz factors required for significant beaming of core\u000ajets may be reconciled with subluminal motions of knots in the core if these\u000aare reverse shocks advected by the jet. Moderate jet Lorentz factors are\u000apossible if the shocks are normal and higher Lorentz factors are possible if\u000athe shocks are oblique. This paper provides support for the idea that the\u000atransition from two-sided to one-sided jets across the FRI/II break is due to\u000athe transition from\u000a

V  We study the prospects for the current microlensing searches, which have\u000arecently discovered several candidates, to yield useful information about the\u000aflattening of the Galaxy dark matter halo. Models of HI warps and N-body\u000asimulations of galaxy formation suggest that disks commonly form in oblate\u000ahalos with a tilt between the disk and halo symmetry axes. The microlensing\u000aoptical depth for the Large Magellanic Cloud depends sensitively on the\u000adisk-halo tilt angle in the Milky Way. We conclude that a much larger spread in\u000avalues for $\u005ctau(LMC)$ is consistent with rotation curve constraints than\u000apreviously thought, and that the ratio $\u005ctau(SMC)/\u005ctau(LMC)$ of the optical\u000adepth to the Small and Large Magellanic clouds is not a clean test of halo\u000aflattening.\u000a

V  The Seyfert galaxy NGC 6814 is known to show periodic variation of its X-ray\u000aluminosity. We found that the sequences of peaks (variability patterns) in the\u000afolded X-ray light curves constructed from the {\u005cit Exosat} and {\u005cit Ginga}\u000adata are remarkably similar when one ignores amplitudes of the peaks and\u000aconsiders only their phases.

V  The ability to now make measurements of Be and B as well as put constraints\u000aon \u005clisix\u005c abundances in metal-poor stars has led to a detailed reexamination\u000aof Big Bang Nucleosynthesis in the $A\u005cgroughly6$ regime. The nuclear reaction\u000anetwork has been significantly expanded with many new rates added. It is\u000ademonstrated that although a number of $A>7$ reaction rates are poorly\u000adetermined, even with extreme values chosen, the standard homogeneous model is\u000aunable to produce significant yields (Be/H and B/H $<10^{-17}$ when $A\u005cle7$\u000aabundances fit) above $A=7$ and the \u005cliseven/\u005clisix\u005c ratio always exceeds 500.\u000aWe also preliminarily explore inhomogeneous models, such as those inspired by a\u000afirst order quark-hadron phase transition, where regions with high\u000aneutron/proton ratios can allow some leakage up to $A>7$. However models that\u000afit the $A\u005cle7$ abundances still seem to have difficulty in obtaining\u000asignificant $A>7$ yields.\u000a

V  The Sachs-Wolfe effect is known to produce large angular scale fluctuations\u000ain the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) due to gravitational\u000apotential fluctuations. We show how the angular correlation function of the\u000aCMBR can be expressed explicitly in terms of the mass autocorrelation function\u000a$\u005cxi (r)$ in the Universe. We derive analytic expressions for the angular\u000acorrelation function and its multipole moments in terms of integrals over $\u005cxi\u000a(r)$ or its second moment, $J_3 (r)$, which does not need to satisfy the sort\u000aof integral constraint that $\u005cxi (r)$ must. We derive similar expressions for\u000abulk flow velocity in terms of $\u005cxi$ and $J_3$. One interesting result that\u000aemerges directly from this analysis is that, for angles $\u005ctheta$, there is a\u000asubstantial contribution to the correlation function from a wide range of\u000adistance $r$ and that the radial shape of this contribution does not vary\u000agreatly with angle.\u000a

V  Using cosmological $N$-body simulations and the void probability function\u000a(VPF), we investigate the statistical properties of voids within a wide range\u000aof initially Gaussian models for the origin of large-scale structure. We pay\u000aparticular attention to the ability of the VPF to diagnose `biased galaxy\u000aformation': the preferential formation of galaxies in regions of high\u000abackground density and corresponding suppression of galaxy formation in regions\u000aof low background density. Biased models have systematically higher VPFs than\u000aunbiased models, but for a given biasing scheme the VPF is relatively\u000ainsensitive to the value of the bias factor $b$. Thus, while the VPF can\u000adistinguish unbiased models from some biased models, it is probably not a\u000auseful way to constrain the bias factor; uncertainties in the appropriate\u000achoice of biasing prescription overwhelm the mild dependence on $b$. We compare\u000athe predictions of our models to the most extensive VPF observations published\u000ato date. These data do {\u005cit not} require strong biasing; Gaussian models in\u000awhich galaxies trace mass can reproduce the VPF data to within the errors\u000aexpected from the current finite volume fluctuations. Models with the moderate\u000abiasing predicted by cosmological simulations with gas dynamics yield a\u000aslightly better match to the data. Models in which galaxy formation is strongly\u000asuppressed in low density regions produce an excess of large, empty voids.\u000a

V  We present the results of a search for X--ray luminous distant clusters of\u000agalaxies. We found extended X--ray emission characteristic of a cluster towards\u000atwo of our candidate clusters of galaxies. They both have a luminosity in the\u000aROSAT bandpass of $\u005csimeq10^{44}{\u005crm \u005c,erg\u005c,s^{-1}}$ and a redshift of $>0.5$;\u000athus making them two of the most distant X--ray clusters ever observed.\u000aFurthermore, we show that both clusters are optically rich and have a known\u000aradio source associated with them. We compare our result with other recent\u000asearches for distant X--ray luminous clusters and present a lower limit of\u000a$1.2\u005ctimes10^{-7}\u005c,{\u005crm Mpc^{-3}}$ for the number density of such high redshift\u000aclusters. This limit is consistent with the expected abundance of such clusters\u000ain a standard (b=2) Cold Dark Matter Universe. Finally, our clusters provide\u000aimportant high redshift targets for further study into the origin and evolution\u000aof massive clusters of galaxies.

V  We present a study of the radio emission from rotating, charged dust grains\u000aimmersed in the ionized gas constituting the thick, H$\u005calpha$-emitting disk of\u000amany spiral galaxies. Using up-to-date optical constants, the charge on the\u000agrains exposed to the diffuse galactic UV flux has been calculated. An\u000aanalytical approximation for the grain charge has been derived, which is then\u000aused to obtain the grain rotation frequency. Grains are found to have\u000asubstantial radio emission peaked at a cutoff frequency in the range\u000a10-100~GHz, depending on the grain size distribution and on the efficiency of\u000athe radiative damping of the grain rotation. The dust radio emission is\u000acompared to the free-free emission from the ionized gas component; some\u000aconstraints on the magnetic field strength in the observed dusty filaments are\u000aalso discussed. The model can be used to test the disk-halo interface\u000aenvironment in spiral galaxies, to determine the amount and size distribution\u000aof dust in their ionized component, and to investigate the rotation mechanisms\u000afor the dust. Numerical estimates are given for experimental purposes.\u000a

V  We use N-body simulations to study the shape of mean cluster density and\u000avelocity profiles formed via gravitational instability. The dependence of the\u000afinal structure on both cosmology and initial density field is examined, using\u000aa grid of cosmologies and scale-free initial power spectra P\u005cpropto k^n. For\u000aeach model, we stack clusters to define an average density profile in the\u000anon-linear regime. The profiles are well fit by a power law over 99% of the\u000acluster volume, with a clear trend toward steeper slopes with both increasing n\u000aand decreasing Omega_o. For models with a Omega_o = 0.2, the profile slopes are\u000aconsistently higher than those for Omega-1.0. Cluster density profiles are thus\u000apotentially useful cosmological diagnostics. We find no evidence for a constant\u000adensity core in any of the models, although the density profiles do tend to\u000aflatten at small radii. Much of the flattening is due to the force softening\u000arequired by the simulations, and an attempt is made to recover the unsoftened\u000aprofiles assuming angular momentum invariance. The recovered profiles in the\u000aOmega=1 cosmologies are consistent with a pure power law up to the highest\u000adensity contrasts (10^6) accessible with our resolution. The low density models\u000ashow significant deviations from a power law above density contrasts \u005csim 10^5.\u000aWe interpret this curvature as reflecting the non scale-invariant nature of the\u000abackground cosmology in these models.\u000a

V  Model surface brightness profiles based on Fokker-Planck simulations have\u000abeen used to assess the high resolution surface brightness profile of the\u000aglobular cluster NGC 6397 of Lauzeral et al. (1992). The profile is well fitted\u000aby the model in the maximum-expansion phase of a gravothermal oscillation with\u000aa core radius of 0.06 pc (6''), but an unresolved core cannot be ruled out. A\u000acore this size is also expected in highly evolved clusters including\u000asignificant numbers of primordial binaries. A more massive cluster will provide\u000abetter statistics, as would star counts. The greater distance of the other\u000aglobular clusters and the requirements of star counting will demand very high\u000aresolution observations to definitively resolve cores this size.\u000a

V  It is proposed that gamma-ray bursts are created in the mergers of double\u000aneutron star binaries and black hole neutron star binaries at cosmological\u000adistances. Bursts with complex profiles and relatively long durations are the\u000aresult of magnetic flares generated by the Parker instability in a post-merger\u000adifferentially-rotating disk. Some bursts may also be produced through\u000aneutrino-antineutrino annihilation into electrons and positrons. In both cases,\u000aan optically thick fireball of size $\u005csles\u005c 100$ km is initially created, which\u000aexpands ultrarelativistically to large radii before radiating. Several previous\u000aobjections to the cosmological merger model are eliminated. It is predicted\u000athat $\u005cgamma$-ray bursts will be accompanied by a burst of gravitational\u000aradiation from the spiraling-in binary which could be detected by LIGO.\u000a

V  We describe a one-parameter family of models of stable spherical stellar\u000asystems in which the phase-space distribution function depends only on energy.\u000aThe models have similar density profiles in their outer parts ($\u005crho\u005cpropto\u000ar^{-4}$) and central power-law density cusps, $\u005crho\u005cpropto r^{3-\u005ceta}$,\u000a$0<\u005ceta\u005cle 3$. The family contains the Jaffe (1983) and Hernquist (1990) models\u000aas special cases. We evaluate the surface brightness profile, the line-of-sight\u000avelocity dispersion profile, and the distribution function, and discuss analogs\u000aof King's core-fitting formula for determining mass-to-light ratio. We also\u000ageneralize the models to a two-parameter family, in which the galaxy contains a\u000acentral black hole; the second parameter is the mass of the black hole. Our\u000amodels can be used to estimate the detectability of central black holes and the\u000avelocity-dispersion profiles of galaxies that contain central cusps, with or\u000awithout a central black hole.\u000a

V  We construct models of highly-inclined (``polar'') rings in an external\u000apotential including both self--gravity and dissipation due to a drag force. We\u000aadopt the oblate spheroidal scale--free logarithmic potential with axis ratio\u000a$q=0.85$ and an initial inclination of 80$^\u005ccirc$ for the self--gravitating\u000arings. Stellar (dissipationless) rings suffer from mass loss during their\u000aevolution which drives a secular change of the mean inclination toward the\u000apoles of the potential. As much as half of the ring mass escapes in the process\u000aand forms an inner and an outer shell of precessing orbits. If the remaining\u000amass is more than $\u005csim$ 0.02 of the enclosed galaxy mass, rings remain bound\u000aand and are not destroyed by differential precession. The rings precess at a\u000aconstant rate for more than a precession period $\u005ctau_p$ finding the\u000aconfiguration predicted by Sparke in 1986 which warps at larger radii toward\u000athe poles of the potential. We model shear viscosity with a velocity-dependent\u000adrag force and find that nuclear inflow dominates over self--gravity if the\u000acharacteristic viscous inflow time scale $\u005ctau_{vi}$ is shorter than $\u005csim 25\u000a\u005ctau_p$. Rings with $\u005ctau_{vi}/\u005ctau_p \u005c \u005csles \u005c 25$ collapse toward the nucleus\u000aof the potential within one precession period independent of the amount of\u000aself--gravity. Our results imply that stars and gas in real polar rings exhibit\u000amarkedly different dynamical evolutions.\u000a

V  The authors have recently proposed a ``microcanonical functional integral"\u000arepresentation of the density of quantum states of the gravitational field. The\u000aphase of this real--time functional integral is determined by a\u000a``microcanonical" or Jacobi action, the extrema of which are classical\u000asolutions at fixed total energy, not at fixed total time interval as in\u000aHamilton's action. This approach is fully general but is especially well suited\u000ato gravitating systems because for them the total energy can be fixed simply as\u000aa boundary condition on the gravitational field. In this paper we describe how\u000ato obtain Jacobi's action for general relativity. We evaluate it for a certain\u000acomplex metric associated with a rotating black hole and discuss the relation\u000aof the result to the density of states and to the entropy of the black hole.\u000a(Dedicated to Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat in honor of her retirement.)\u000a

V  We show that tidal interaction among galaxy clusters can account for their\u000aobserved alignments and very marked elongation and, consequently, that these\u000acharacteristics of clusters are actually consistent with them being formed in\u000ahierarchical clustering. The well-established distribution of projected axial\u000aratios of clusters with richness class $R\u005cge 0$ is recovered very\u000asatisfactorily by means of a simple model with no free parameters. The main\u000aperturbers are relatively rich ($R\u005cge 1$) single clusters and/or groups of\u000aclusters (superclusters) of a wider richness class ($R\u005cge 0$) located within a\u000adistance of about 65 $h^{-1}$ Mpc from the perturbed cluster. This makes the\u000aproposed scheme be also consistent with all reported alignment effects\u000ainvolving clusters. We find that this tidal interaction is typically in the\u000asaturate regime (\u005cie the maximum elongation allowed for systems in equilibrium\u000ais reached), which explains the very similar intrinsic axial ratio shown by all\u000aclusters. Tides would therefore play an important role in the dynamics of large\u000ascale structures, in particular, they should be taken into account when\u000aestimating the virial mass of clusters.\u000a

V  More than 100 gamma-ray burst progenitor models have now been published in\u000arefereed journals. A list of the models published before the end of 1992 is\u000apresented and briefly discussed. The consensus of the present astronomical\u000acommunity remains that no specific model is particularly favored for cosmic\u000abursts. Recent BATSE results make most of these models untenable in their\u000apresent form, opening up the field to another era of speculative papers. Is\u000aspeculation in this area becoming valueless? Alternatively, one may argue that\u000athe new data makes many of the old models untenable, and simply adapting old\u000amodels may not be sufficient. With this in mind, three relatively unexplored\u000a"toy" paradigms are suggested from which more detailed models for the\u000aprogenitors of gamma-ray bursts may be made.\u000a

V  The presence of protostellar disks can greatly increase the dissipation\u000aduring close stellar encounters, leading to the formation of a significant\u000apopulation of binaries during the initial collapse and virialization of a\u000acluster. We have used N-body simulations of collapsing globular clusters to\u000afind the major factors that determine the efficiency of binary formation\u000athrough star-disk captures. This work serves the dual purpose of verifying the\u000aresults of earlier analytic work as well as examining parameters not testable\u000aby that work. As in the earlier work, typical binary fractions of a few percent\u000aare found. For the parameters studied, the results are found to depend\u000aremarkably little upon disk evolution, the mass distribution of the stars, or\u000atheir spatial distribution, though distributions in which the stars are highly\u000aclumped yield binary fractions larger by a factor of a few. The direct N-body\u000aintegrations limit the models to relatively small values of N. Semiempirical\u000arelations are derived, however, which allow the results to be extrapolated to\u000avalues of N appropriate to globular clusters.\u000a

V  The properties of the probability distribution function of the cosmological\u000acontinuous density field are studied. We present further developments and\u000acompare dynamically motivated methods to derive the PDF. One of them is based\u000aon the Zel'dovich approximation (ZA). We extend this method for arbitrary\u000ainitial conditions, regardless of whether they are Gaussian or not. The other\u000aapproach is based on perturbation theory with Gaussian initial fluctuations. We\u000ainclude the smoothing effects in the PDFs. We examine the relationships between\u000athe shapes of the PDFs and the moments. It is found that formally there are no\u000amoments in the ZA, but a way to resolve this issue is proposed, based on the\u000aregularization of integrals. A closed form for the generating function of the\u000amoments in the ZA is also presented, including the smoothing effects. We\u000asuggest the methods to build PDFs out of the whole series of the moments, or\u000aout of a limited number of moments -- the Edgeworth expansion. The last\u000aapproach gives us an alternative method to evaluate the skewness and kurtosis\u000aby measuring the PDF around its peak. We note a general connection between the\u000agenerating function of moments for small r.m.s $\u005csigma$ and the non-linear\u000aevolution of the overdense spherical fluctuation in the dynamical models. All\u000athese approaches have been applied in 1D case where the ZA is exact, and simple\u000aanalytical results are obtained. The 3D case is analyzed in the same manner and\u000awe found a mutual agreement in the PDFs derived by different methods in the the\u000aquasi-linear regime. Numerical CDM simulation was used to validate the accuracy\u000aof considered approximations. We explain the successful log-normal fit of the\u000aPDF from that simulation at moderate $\u005csigma$ as mere fortune, but not as a\u000auniversal form of density PDF in general.\u000a

V  If gamma-ray bursts originate at cosmological distances then their angular\u000adistribution should exhibit a dipole in the direction of the solar motion\u000arelative to the cosmic microwave background. This is due to the combined\u000aeffects of abberation, an anisotropic shift of the burst event rate, and an\u000aangular variation in the distance out to which bursts can be detected.\u000a  We derive the amplitude of the expected dipole for an open and flat\u000acosmological model, and for various possible evolution rates of the burst\u000apopulation. Although our dimensionless velocity with respect to the CMB rest\u000aframe is of order $10^{-3}$, the dipole amplitude is of order $10^{-2}$, an\u000aorder of magnitude larger. The results depend very weakly on the value of\u000a$\u005cOmega_0$, but are sensitive to the spectral index of the bursts' photon\u000aspectra, and to the rate of evolution of the burst population. There is no\u000adependence on the value of the Hubble constant.\u000a  A clear detection of the dipole will require a larger sample of bursts than\u000acurrently available (of order $10^4$). Future statistical analyses of the\u000ahypothesis that bursts originate at cosmological distances should take this\u000aeffect into account, rather than assuming a perfectly isotropic distribution,\u000afor obtaining the correct statistical significance of their results.\u000a

V  To first order in the deviation from scale invariance the inflationary\u000apotential and its first two derivatives can be expressed in terms of the\u000aspectral indices of the scalar and tensor perturbations, $n$ and $n_T$, and\u000atheir contributions to the variance of the quadrupole CBR temperature\u000aanisotropy, $S$ and $T$. In addition, there is a ``consistency relation''\u000abetween these quantities: $n_T= -{1\u005cover 7}{T\u005cover S}$. We discuss the overall\u000astrategy of perturbative reconstruction and derive the second-order expressions\u000afor the inflationary potential and its first two derivatives and the\u000afirst-order expression for its third derivative, all in terms of $n$, $n_T$,\u000a$S$, $T$, and $dn/d\u005cln k$. We also obtain the second-order consistency\u000arelation, $n_T =-{1\u005cover 7}{T\u005cover S}[1+0.11{T\u005cover S} + 0.15 (n-1)]$. As an\u000aexample we consider the exponential potential, the only known case where exact\u000aanalytic solutions for the perturbation spectra exist. We reconstruct the\u000apotential via Taylor expansion (with coefficients calculated at both first and\u000asecond order), and introduce the Pad\u005c'{e} approximant as a greatly improved\u000aalternative.\u000a

V  Wheeler-DeWitt equation is applied to $k > 0$ Friedmann Robertson Walker\u000ametric with various types of matter. It is shown that if the Universe ends in\u000athe matter dominated era (e.g., radiation or pressureless gas) with zero\u000acosmological constant, then the resulting Wheeler-DeWitt equation describes a\u000abound state problem. As solutions of a non-degenerate bound state system, the\u000aeigen-wave functions are real (Hartle-Hawking) and the usual issue associated\u000awith the ambiguity in the boundary conditions for the wave functions is\u000aresolved. Furthermore, as a bound state problem, there exists a quantization\u000acondition that relates the curvature of the three space with the energy density\u000aof the Universe. Incorporating a cosmological constant in the early Universe\u000a(inflation) is given as a natural explanation for the large quantum number\u000aassociated with our Universe, which resulted from the quantization condition.\u000a  It is also shown that if there is a cosmological constant $\u005cLambda > 0$ in\u000aour Universe that persists for all time, then the resulting Wheeler-DeWitt\u000aequation describes a non-bound state system, regardless of the magnitude of the\u000acosmological constant. As a consequence, the wave functions are in general\u000acomplex (Vilenkin) and the initial conditions for wave functions are a free\u000aparameters not determined by the formalism.\u000a

V  Using observations of the 2496.7 A B I line with the HST GHRS at a nominal\u000aresolution of 90,000, we have found the abundance of boron of HD 140283 to be\u000alog epsilon_B (= 12 + log (N_B/N_H)) = 0.34 \u005cpm 0.20. This result is found when\u000aa significant non-LTE effect in the formation of the B I line is taken into\u000aaccount. The resulting N_B/N_Be ratio is about 17 (in the range 9 -- 34), which\u000ais in very good agreement with what is expected from spallation by cosmic rays.\u000aWe conclude that this origin of Be and B in the Early Galaxy is the most\u000aprobable of recently suggested formation mechanisms.

V  A perturber may excite a coherent mode in a star cluster or galaxy. If the\u000astellar system is stable, it is commonly assumed that such a mode will be\u000astrongly damped and therefore of little practical consequence other than\u000aredistributing momentum and energy deposited by the perturber. This paper\u000ademonstrates that this assumption is false; weakly damped modes exist and may\u000apersist long enough to have observable consequences. To do this, a method for\u000ainvestigating the dispersion relation for spherical stellar systems and for\u000alocating weakly damped modes in particular is developed and applied to King\u000amodels of varying concentration. This leads to the following remarkable result:\u000aKing models exhibit {\u005cit very} weakly damped $m=1$ modes over a wide range of\u000aconcentration ($0.67\u005cle c\u005cle1.5$ have been examined). The predicted damping\u000atime is tens to hundreds of crossing times. This mode causes the peak density\u000ato shift from and slowly revolve about the initial center. The existence of the\u000amode is supported by n-body simulation. Higher order modes and possible\u000aastronomical consequences are discussed. Weakly damped modes, for example, may\u000aprovide a natural explanation for observed discrepancies between density and\u000akinematic centers in galaxies, the location of velocity cusps due to massive\u000ablack holes, and $m=1$ disturbances of disks embedded in massive halos.\u000aGravitational shocking may excite the $m=1$ mode in globular clusters, which\u000acould modify their subsequent evolution and displace the positions of exotic\u000aremnants.\u000a

V  Based on 1) a conjecture about the mean free path for particle scattering in\u000aperpendicular shock geometries, and 2) a model for Wolf Rayet star winds, we\u000aargue that explosions of Wolf Rayet stars can lead through diffusive particle\u000aacceleration to particle energies up to 3 10^9 GeV. As a test we first\u000ademonstrate that the magnetic fields implied by this argument are compatible\u000awith the dynamo limit applied to the convective interior of the main sequence\u000astars which are predecessors of Wolf Rayet stars; second we show that this\u000aimplies the same strength of the magnetic fields as is suggested by the\u000amagnetically driven wind theory. Third, we use data from radio supernovae to\u000acheck the spectrum, luminosity and time dependence which suggest that the\u000amagnetic fields again have to be as high as suggested by the magnetically\u000adriven wind theory. This constitutes evidence for the magnetic field strengths\u000arequired to accelerate particles to 3 10^9 GeV. Fourth, we demonstrate that\u000awithin our picture the nonthermal radio emission from OB and Wolf Rayet stars\u000acan reproduce the proper radio spectra, time variability and radio\u000aluminosities. Fifth, the comparison of Wolf Rayet stars and radio supernovae\u000asuggests that electron injection into the acceleration process is a step\u000afunction of efficiency with the shock speed as the independent parameter.\u000a

V  Possibly the only unambiguous verification that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are\u000aat cosmological distances would be the observation of multiple images of a\u000agravitationally lensed burst. Each images would arrive at a different time, but\u000aexhibit identical light curves. We improve upon previous calculations of GRB\u000alensing by using revised cosmological burst models based upon better knowledge\u000aof burst spectra, and we consider several sets of cosmological parameters. Only\u000alensing by the known population of galaxies is considered, and we compute the\u000alensing rate and amplification bias using three different lens models. Assuming\u000athat 800 bursts per year are above the detection threshold of the BATSE\u000aexperiment on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory, we predict one lensing event\u000aevery 1.5--25 years, with a median time delay between images of about 7 days.\u000aHowever, BATSE has an instrumental efficiency of about 12\u005c% for detecting\u000adouble bursts, decreasing the detection rate to fewer than one per century for\u000asome cosmological parameters. This inefficiency can be overcome partially if\u000acases of quadruple imaging by elliptical potentials are common, but simulations\u000ashow that lensing by elliptical potentials enhances the detection rate by only\u000aabout 20\u005c%. We conclude that it is unlikely that the BATSE experiment will\u000adetect a lensed burst, but that a future experiment, which is either much more\u000asensitive or has a much more efficient duty cycle, could.\u000a

V  We report on a recent paper (Wei\u005css\u005c \u005c& Buchert 1993), where we carry out\u000apencil beam constructions in a high-resolution simulation of the large-scale\u000astructure of galaxies. As an example we present the results for the case of\u000a``Hot-Dark-Matter" (HDM) initial conditions (with scale-free $n = 1$ power\u000aindex on large scales and $\u005cOmega = 1$) as a representative of models with\u000asufficient large-scale power. We use an analytic approximation for particle\u000atrajectories of a self-gravitating dust continuum and apply a local dynamical\u000abiasing of volume elements to identify luminous matter in the model. Using this\u000amethod, we are able to resolve formally a simulation box of 1200h^-1 Mpc (e.g.\u000afor HDM initial conditions) down to the scale of galactic halos using $2160^3$\u000aparticles. Pencil beam probes are taken for a given epoch using the parameters\u000aof observed beams. In particular, our analysis concentrates on the detection of\u000aa quasi-periodicity in the beam probes. The simulation is designed for\u000aapplication to parameter studies which prepare future observational projects.\u000aWe find that a large percentage of the beams shows quasi-periodicities with\u000aperiods which cluster at a certain length scale. The periods found range\u000abetween one and eight times the cutoff length in the initial fluctuation\u000aspectrum.\u000a

V  We consider whether the hard X-ray and soft gamma-ray emission from Centaurus\u000aA is beamed radiation from the active nucleus which is Compton-scattered into\u000aour line-of-sight. We derive the spectrum and degree of polarization of\u000ascattered radiation when incident beamed radiation is scattered from a cold\u000a($kT<<m_ec^2$) electron cloud moving with bulk relativistic motion along the\u000ajet axis, and calculate results for an unpolarized, highly-beamed incident\u000apower-law photon source. We fit the OSSE data from Centaurus A with this model\u000aand find that if the scatterers are not moving relativistically, then the angle\u000athe jet makes with respect to our line-of-sight is $61^\u005ccirc\u005cpm 5^\u005ccirc$. We\u000apredict a high degree of polarization of the scattered radiation below\u000a$\u005csim300$ keV. Future measurements with X-ray and gamma-ray polarimeters could\u000abe used to constrain or rule out such a scenario.\u000a

V  We describe a refined calculation of high energy emission from\u000arotation-powered pulsars based on the Outer Gap model of Cheng, Ho \u005c&~Ruderman\u000a(1986a,b). We have improved upon previous efforts to model the spectra from\u000athese pulsars (e. g. Cheng, et al. 1986b; Ho 1989) by following the variation\u000ain particle production and radiation properties with position in the outer gap.\u000aCurvature, synchrotron and inverse-Compton scattering fluxes vary significantly\u000aover the gap and their interactions {\u005cit via} photon-photon pair production\u000abuild up the radiating charge populations at varying rates. We have also\u000aincorporated an approximate treatment of the transport of particle and photon\u000afluxes between gap emission zones. These effects, along with improved\u000acomputations of the particle and photon distributions, provide very important\u000amodifications of the model gamma-ray flux. In particular, we attempt to make\u000aspecific predictions of pulse profile shapes and spectral variations as a\u000afunction of pulse phase and suggest further extensions to the model which may\u000aprovide accurate computations of the observed high energy emissions.\u000a

V  Nearby starburst galaxies have consistently shown anomalous Ly-alpha/H-beta\u000aratios. By re-analysing the published IUE/optical observations, we show that\u000amost starbursts present a normal Ly-alpha emission, consistent with case B\u000arecombination theory, provided extinction laws appropriate to their\u000ametallicities are used. This implies that extinction is more important than\u000amultiple resonant scattering effects. The anomalous emission and absorption\u000alines present in a few remaining galaxies are simply explained if they are\u000aobserved in the post-burst phase, between about 10$^7$ and 10$^8$ yrs after the\u000astart of the burst. We use updated stellar population synthesis models to show\u000athat anomalous ratios are produced by the aging of stellar populations, since\u000athe underlying stellar Ly-alpha line is important in the cooler massive stars.\u000aThe inferred low-duty cycle of massive star formation accounts naturally for\u000athe failure to detect large numbers of Ly-alpha--emitting galaxies in deep\u000asurveys and at high redshift. Some testable predictions of the proposed\u000ascenario are also discussed.\u000a

V  There are now a half dozen young pulsars detected in high energy photons by\u000athe Compton GRO, showing a variety of emission efficiencies and pulse profiles.\u000aWe present here a calculation of the pattern of high energy emission on the sky\u000ain a model which posits $\u005cgamma$-ray production by charge depleted gaps in the\u000aouter magnetosphere. This model accounts for the radio to $\u005cgamma$-ray pulse\u000aoffsets of the known pulsars, as well as the shape of the high energy pulse\u000aprofiles. We also show that $\u005csim 1/3$ of emitting young radio pulsars will not\u000abe detected due to beaming effects, while $\u005csim 2.5 \u005ctimes$ the number of\u000aradio-selected $\u005cgamma$-ray pulsars will be viewed only high energies. Finally\u000awe compute the polarization angle variation and find that the previously\u000amisunderstood optical polarization sweep of the Crab pulsar arises naturally in\u000athis picture. These results strongly support an outer-magnetosphere location\u000afor the $\u005cgamma-$ray emission.\u000a

V  If $\u005cnu_\u005cmu$ or $\u005cnu_\u005ctau$ mix with $\u005cnu_e$, neutrino oscillations and\u000acollisions in a supernova (SN) core allow these flavors effectively to\u000aparticipate in $\u005cbeta$ equilibrium and thus to obtain a large chemical\u000apotential. If a sterile species mixes with $\u005cnu_e$, these effects lead to an\u000aanomalous loss of energy and lepton number. We study flavor conversion in a SN\u000acore on the basis of a new kinetic equation which rigorously includes neutrino\u000ainterference and degeneneracy effects. Our discussion serves as an example and\u000aillustration of the properties of this ``non-abelian Boltzmann equation''.\u000a

V  We consider the evolution of perturbations to a flat FRW universe that arise\u000afrom a ``stiff source,'' such as a self-ordering cosmic field that forms in a\u000aglobal symmetry-breaking phase transition and evolves via the Kibble mechanism.\u000aAlthough the linear response of the normal matter to the source depends on the\u000adetails of the source dynamics, we show that the higher-order non-linear\u000aperturbative equations reduce to a form identical to those of source-free\u000aNewtonian gravity in the small wavelength limit. Consequently, the resulting\u000a$n$-point correlation functions and their spectral counterparts will have a\u000ahierarchical contribution arising from this gravitational evolution (as in the\u000asource-free case) in addition to that possibly coming from non-Gaussian initial\u000aconditions. We apply this formalism to the $O(N)$ nonlinear sigma model at\u000alarge $N$ and find that observable differences from the case of initially\u000aGaussian perturbations and Newtonian gravity in the bispectrum and higher-order\u000acorrelations are not expected on scales smaller than about $100\u005c,h^{-1}{\u005crm\u000aMpc}$.\u000a

V  Quasar-galaxy associations, if they result from the effect of gravitational\u000alensing by foreground galaxies, depend sensitively on the shape of the quasar\u000anumber counts. Two kinds of quasar number-magnitude relations are predicted to\u000aproduce quite different properties in quasar-galaxy associations: the counts of\u000aBoyle, Shanks and Peterson (1988; BSP) provide both positive and ``negative"\u000aassociations between distant quasars and foreground galaxies, relating closely\u000awith the knee ($B\u005capprox19.15$) in these counts. However, Hawkins and V\u005c'eron\u000a(1993; HV) quasar data lead to only a positive magnitude-independent\u000aquasar-galaxy association. The current observational evidence on quasar-galaxy\u000aassociations, either positive or null, is shown to be the natural result of\u000agravitational lensing if quasars follow the BSP number-magnitude relation. On\u000athe other hand, the HV counts are unable to produce the reported associations\u000aby the mechanism of gravitational lensing. It is emphasized that special\u000aattention should be paid to the limiting magnitudes in the selected quasar\u000asamples when one works on quasar-galaxy associations.\u000a

A comparison of the results with a\u000asample of control fields, bootstrapping analyses, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests\u000aprovide unambiguous support for the statistical significance of the\u000acorrelations found. We argue that the detected enhanced diffuse X-ray emission\u000ais in the foreground of the QSOs, and that it is probably due to galaxy\u000aclusters which magnify the QSOs by their gravitational lensing effect, thereby\u000agiving rise to a magnification bias in the background source sample. A\u000acomparison of the results presented below with correlations previously found\u000abetween the same QSO sample and either Lick or IRAS galaxies provides further\u000aevidence for this interpretation, and identifies positions in the sky where\u000aweak gravitational lensing may be detected by searching for coherent\u000adistortions of background galaxy images.\u000a

V  There is now abundant evidence for the presence of large quantities of unseen\u000amatter surrounding normal galaxies, including our own$^{1,2}$. The nature of\u000athis `dark matter' is unknown, except that it cannot be made of normal stars,\u000adust, or gas, as they would be easily detected. Exotic particles such as\u000aaxions, massive neutrinos or other weakly interacting massive particles\u000a(collectively known as WIMPs) have been proposed)$^{3,4}$, but have yet to be\u000adetected. A less exotic alternative is normal matter in the form of bodies with\u000amasses ranging from that of a large planet to a few $ \u005cmsun$. Such objects,\u000aknown collectively as massive compact halo objects$^5$ (MACHOs) might be brown\u000adwarfs or `Jupiters' (bodies too small to produce their own energy by fusion),\u000aneutron stars, old white dwarfs, or black holes. Paczynski$^6$ suggested that\u000aMACHOs might act as gravitational microlenses, occasionally causing the\u000aapparent brightness of distant background stars temporarily to increase. We are\u000aconducting a microlensing experiment to determine whether the dark matter halo\u000aof our galaxy is made up of MACHOs. Here we report a candidate for a\u000amicrolensing event, detected by monitoring the light curves of 1.8 million\u000astars in the Large Magellanic Cloud for one year. The light curve shows no\u000avariation for most of the year of data taking, and an upward excursion lasting\u000aover 1 month, with a maximum increase of $\u005capprox \u005cbf 2$ mag. The most probable\u000alens mass, inferred from the duration of the event, is $\u005cbf \u005csim 0.1 \u005c,\u005cmsun$.\u000a

V  The lensing effect of curved space, which can cause the angular diameter of a\u000afixed reference length seen on the sky to reach a minimum and then increase\u000awith redshift, depends sensitively on the value of the cosmological constant,\u000a$\u005cLambda$, in a flat universe. The redshift of an observed minimum and the\u000aasymptotic slope can in principle provide strong constraints on $\u005cLambda$. The\u000asensitivity to a non-zero cosmological constant in a flat universe is compared\u000ato the sensitivity to $q_0$ in an open universe without a cosmological\u000aconstant, and to inherent ambiguities due to uncertainties in distance measures\u000aand the possible effects of evolution. If evolutionary uncertainties can be\u000aovercome, the reported observations of the angular diameter of compact radio\u000ajets as a function of redshift, which appear to exhibit such a minimum, could\u000aprovide the strongest available limit on the cosmological constant in a flat\u000auniverse, and on $\u005cOmega$ in an open universe.\u000a

V  We have examined the consequences of assuming the existence of a light scalar\u000aboson, weakly coupled to neutrinos, and not coupled to any other light\u000afermions. For a range of parameters, we find that this hypothesis leads to the\u000adevelopment of neutrino clusters which form in the early Universe and which\u000aprovide gravitational fluctuations on scales small compared to a parsec (i.e.,\u000athe scale of solar systems). The existence of such clustering produces an\u000aeffect which would appear as a negative mass squared for the electron neutrino\u000ain Tritium beta decay, without conflicting with other experiments. The neutrino\u000amasses arising in unified gauge theories would then be very much larger than\u000athe masses extracted from experiments within the solar system.\u000a

V  The evolution of probability distribution functions (PDFs) of continuous\u000adensity, velocity and velocity derivatives ( deformation tensor) fields in the\u000atheory of cosmological gravitational instability are considered. We show that\u000ain the Newtonian theory the dynamical equations cannot be reduced to the closed\u000aset of Lagrangian equations.\u000a  Since continuous fields from galaxy surveys need sufficiently large smoothing\u000awhich exceeds the scale of nonlinearity, one can use the Zel'dovich\u000aapproximation to describe the mildly non-linear matter evolution, which allows\u000athe closed set of Lagrangian equations. The closed kinetic equation for the\u000ajoint PDF of cosmological continuous fields is derived in this approximation.\u000a  The analytical theory of the cosmological PDFs with arbitrary (including\u000aGaussian) initial statistics is developed, based on the solution on the kinetic\u000aequaiton. For Gaussian initial fluctuations, the PDFs are parametrized by only\u000alinear {\u005cit rms} fluctuations $\u005csigma$ on given filtering scale. Density PDF\u000a$P(\u005crho, t)$ and PDF $M(\u005clambda_1, \u005clambda_2, \u005clambda_3; t)$ of eigenvalues of\u000athe deformation tensor field in the Eulerian space evolve very rapidly in\u000anon-linear regime. On the contrary, velocity PDF $Q(\u005cvec v, t)$ remains\u000ainvariant under non-linear evolution. For small $\u005csigma$ the Edgworth series is\u000asuggested to reconstruct\u000a

V  We have made angular broadening measurements in the satellite line of the OH\u000amolecule at 1612 MHz of 8 OH/IR stars located near the Galactic Center with the\u000aVery Large Array. Early observations with the Very Long Baseline Array had\u000arevealed a region of pronounced scattering approximately centered on SgrA*.\u000aThese new observations show that the compact line emission from these stars is\u000ascattered by an amount that is two to three times larger than had been\u000apreviously seen. Additionally, we measure non-circular scattering disks for\u000athese objects, evidence that the electron density variations are distributed\u000aanisotropically. The present data suggest that the enhanced turbulence is\u000alocated near the Galactic Center. However, we cannot completely rule out that\u000athe scattering is caused by an unrelated region along the line of sight.\u000a

V  Bubbles in a first-order electroweak phase transition are nucleated with\u000aradii $R_0$ and expand with velocity $v$. If $v$ is subsonic, a bubble becomes\u000aunstable to non-spherical perturbations when its radius is roughly $10^4\u005c,\u000aR_0$. These perturbations accelerate the transition, and the effective velocity\u000aof bubble growth rapidly becomes supersonic. The transition should subsequently\u000aproceed spherically via detonation. If for some reason the onset of detonation\u000ais postponed, the surface area of the bubbles may be enhanced by $10^5$. We\u000adiscuss consequences for electroweak baryogenesis.\u000a

V  We review recent progress in our understanding of the physics of energetic\u000aparticles in our Galaxy, in active galaxies such as starburst galaxies, in\u000aactive galactic nuclei and in the jets and radio hot spots of powerful radio\u000agalaxies and radioloud quasars. We propose that cosmic rays originate mainly in\u000athree sites, a) normal supernova explosions into the approximately homogeneous\u000ainterstellar medium, b) supernova explosions into stellar winds, and c) hot\u000aspots of powerful radio galaxies. The predictions based on this proposition\u000ahave been tested successfully against airshower data over the particle energy\u000arange from 10 TeV to 100 EeV. The low energy cosmic ray particles carried out\u000aby galactic winds to the intergalactic medium may ionize and heat this medium\u000aconsistent with all known constraints. Furthermore we propose that radioloud\u000aquasars accelerate nuclei to high energies in shocks in the inner sections of\u000atheir jets, and thus initiate hadronic cascades which produce the $\u005cgamma$-ray\u000aemission observed with GRO. Radio observations of the Galactic center compact\u000asource suggest that there is a jet similar to that in quasars, but very much\u000aweaker in its emission; simple modelling suggests that the power carried by\u000athis jet is of order similar to the accretion disk luminosity. By analogy we\u000aspeculate that also radioweak quasars have jets which carry a large proportion\u000aof the accretion power, and which accelerate particles to high energy.\u000a

An objective\u000acluster--finding algorithm is used to identify clusters of different richness.\u000aFor Gaussian models, the overall number of clusters is too small in the\u000astandard CDM case, but a model with higher normalisation fares much better;\u000anon--Gaussian models with negative skewness also fit faily well.

The emerging picture\u000ais that Gaussian models, even with a higher normalization, are in trouble.\u000aSkew-positive models are also ruled out, while skew-negative models can\u000areproduce the observed clustering of galaxy clusters in the CDM framework.\u000a

V  We study the importance of hydrodynamic effects on the evolution of\u000acoalescing binary neutron stars. Using an approximate energy functional\u000aconstructed from equilibrium solutions for polytropic binary configurations, we\u000aincorporate hydrodynamic effects into the calculation of the orbital decay\u000adriven by gravitational wave emission. In particular, we follow the transition\u000abetween the quasi-static, secular decay of the orbit at large separation and\u000athe rapid dynamical evolution of configurations approaching contact. We show\u000athat a purely Newtonian hydrodynamic instability can significantly accelerate\u000athe coalescence at small separation. Such an instability occurs in all close\u000abinary configurations containing sufficiently incompressible stars.\u000aCalculations are performed for various neutron star masses, radii, spins, and\u000aeffective polytropic indices. Typically, we find that the radial infall\u000avelocity just prior to contact is about 10\u005c% of the tangential orbital\u000avelocity. Post-Newtonian effects can move the stability limit to a larger\u000abinary separation, and may induce an even larger radial velocity. We also\u000aconsider the possibility of mass transfer from one neutron star to the other.\u000aWe show that stable mass transfer is impossible except when the mass of one of\u000athe components is very small (less than about 0.4 solar mass) and the viscosity\u000ais high enough to maintain corotation.\u000a

We introduce a\u000adiffeomorphism invariant, bilinear scalar action, but no ``pure gravity''\u000aaction.\u000a  Evidence for the existence of a non-trivial continuum limit is provided by\u000ashowing that the zero momentum scalar excitation has a finite energy in the\u000alimit of vanishing lattice spacing. Assuming the existence of localized low\u000aenergy states which are described by a natural set of observables, we show that\u000aan effective curved metric will be induced dynamically. The components of the\u000ametric tensor are identified with quasi-local averages of certain microscopic\u000aproperties of the quantum spacetime. The Planck scale is identified with the\u000ahighest mass scale of the matter sector.\u000a

V  Earlier we had suggested that G10.0-0.3, a non-thermal nebula, most likely an\u000aold supernova remnant (SNR), was associated with the soft gamma repeater (SGR)\u000aSGR 1806-20. Here we present new radio images obtained at the Very Large Array\u000a(VLA) of the non-thermal radio nebula G10.0-0.3. The nebula is a plerion with a\u000ahierarchy of nested amorphous components culminating in a peak. The recent\u000adramatic detection of an X-ray point source coincident with the radio peak and\u000aa hard X-ray burst localized to G10.0-0.3 confirms the SNR-SGR association. We\u000apropose that the SGR is an isolated pulsar with both a steady and impulsive\u000arelativistic particle wind and these two together power the nebula. We note\u000athat both this SGR and SGR 0526-66 are offset from the centers of their SNRs\u000awhich requires high space motion of the pulsar. We suggest that some natal\u000amechanism produces high velocity and induces SGR activity.\u000a

V  Since the mass of the electron is very small relative to atomic masses,\u000aThomson scattering of low-energy photons ($h\u005cnu \u005cll m_ec^2$) produces thermal\u000aDoppler frequency shifts that are much larger than atomic Doppler widths. A\u000amethod is developed here to evaluate the electron scattering emissivity from a\u000agiven radiation field which is considerably faster than previous methods based\u000aon straightforward evaluation of the scattering integral. This procedure is\u000aimplemented in our multilevel radiative code (MALI), which now takes full\u000aaccount of the effects of noncoherent electron scattering on level populations,\u000aas well as on the emergent spectrum. Calculations using model atmospheres of\u000ahot, low-gravity stars display not only the expected broad wings of strong\u000aemission lines but also effects arising from the scattering of photons across\u000acontinuum edges. In extreme cases this leads to significant shifts of the\u000aionization equilibrium of helium.\u000a

The behaviour\u000aof such light beams near vertices and conjugate points is investigated, with\u000aspecial attention to the singular behaviour of the optical scalars. We then\u000aspecialize the general transport equation to the case of an approximate metric\u000aof an inhomogeneous universe, which is a Friedmann metric `on average' with\u000asuperposed isolated weak matter inhomogeneities. In a series of well-defined\u000aapproximations, the equations of gravitational lens theory are derived.\u000aFinally, we derive a relative optical focusing equation which describes the\u000afocusing of light beams relative to the case that the beam is unaffected by\u000amatter inhomogeneities in the universe, from which it follows immediately that\u000ano beam can be focused less than one which is unaffected by matter clumps,\u000abefore it propagates through its first conjugate point.\u000a

V  It is suggested that the nonorthodox model of a quasar as a neutrino ball\u000adescribed in terms of the standard model extended by adding right-handed\u000aneutrinos and the Majorana scalar field can be presented in order to explain a\u000aquasar as a body of weak interacting neutrinos. Neutrino interaction with the\u000ascalar Majorana field violates the lepton number and produces the mass\u000asplitting of the neutrino due to the sea-saw mechanism. In this model a quasar\u000ais an object which appears in the result of the first order cosmological phase\u000atransition. In this interpretation a quasar may be regarded as a ball filled\u000awith Dirac neutrinos and can be treated as a remnant of phase transition with\u000aunbroken global lepton symmetry. In this paper we study the macroscopic\u000aparameters of such a configuration. In the result the mass-radius curve M(R)\u000afor the quasar is obtained.\u000a

V  Naked singularities appear naturally in dynamically evolving solutions of\u000aEinstein equations involving gravitational collapse of radiation, dust and\u000aperfect fluids, provided the rate of accretion is less than a critical value.\u000aWe propose that the gamma-ray bursters (GRBs) are examples of these naked\u000asingularity solutions. For illustration, we show that according to solutions\u000ainvolving spherically symmetric collapse of pure radiation field, the energy\u000a$E_\u005cgamma$ and the observed duration $\u005cDelta t_o$ of a GRB should satisfy,\u000a$\u005cfrac{E_\u005cgamma}{\u005cDelta t_o} \u005cleq 4.5 \u005ctimes 10^{58} \u005c f_\u005cgamma $ erg\u000asec$^{-1}$, $f_\u005cgamma$ being the fraction ($10^{-2}$ to $10^{-3}$) of energy\u000areleased as gamma rays. All the presently observed GRBs satisfy this condition;\u000athose satisfying the condition close to equality must necessarily be of\u000acosmological origin with the red-shift factor $z$ not exceeding $\u005csim 2-10$\u000adepending on exact observed flux.\u000a

V  The large scale structure of the universe is reconstructed by means of the\u000aWiener filter and constrained realizations of Gaussian fields. The density\u000afield constructed from optically selected galaxies (Hudson \u005ccite{Hudson}) has\u000abeen sampled out to a distance of $80\u005chmpc$. This data set is used for the\u000areconstruction of the underlying primordial perturbation field. A preliminary\u000areconstruction analysis from the IRAS $1.9Jy$ density field is presented here\u000afor the sake of comparison. The perturbation field within a cube of $160\u005chmpc$\u000aon the side, centered on the Local Group, and with Gaussian smoothing of length\u000a$10\u005chmpc$ is reconstructed, assuming the standard CDM model. In particular, the\u000adensity field at the Zone of Avoidance is studied. A preliminary maximum\u000alikelihood analysis performed on Hudson's data shows that it is consistent with\u000aa tilted CDM with $n\u005csim -0.5\u005cpm 0.3$ and $\u005csigma_8\u005csim 1.4\u005cpm 0.15$\u000a

V  COBE has provided us with a whole-sky map of the CBR anisotropies. However,\u000aeven if the noise level is negligible when the four year COBE data are\u000aavailable, the cosmic variance will prevent us from obtaining information about\u000athe Gaussian nature of the primordial fluctuations.  This important issue is\u000aaddressed here by studying the angular bispectrum of the cosmic microwave\u000abackground anisotropies.  A general form of the angular bispectrum is given and\u000athe cosmic variance of the angular bispectrum for Gaussian fluctuations is\u000acalculated. The advantage of using the angular bispectrum is that one can\u000achoose to use the multipole moments which minimize the cosmic variance term.\u000aThe non-Gaussian signals in most physically motivated non-Gaussian models are\u000asmall compared with cosmic variance. Unless the amplitudes are large, the\u000anon-Gaussian signals are only detectable in the COBE data in those models where\u000athe angular bispectrum is flat or increases with increasing multipole moment.\u000a

Such trapped surfaces surround a region in which there occurs an\u000aenhancement of matter over the average. The conditions are posed directly in\u000aterms of physical variables and show that what one needs is a relatively large\u000aamount of excess matter confined to a small volume. The expansion of the\u000auniverse and an outward flow of matter oppose the formation of trapped\u000asurfaces; an inward flow of matter helps. The model can be regarded as a\u000aFriedmann-Lema\u005c^\u005ci tre-Walker cosmology with localized spherical\u000ainhomogeneities. We show that the total excess mass cannot be too large.\u000a

V  Quashnock and Lamb (1993) defined a sub-sample of Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs)\u000afrom the publicly available BATSE database which shows clumping toward the\u000agalactic plane, and concluded that all GRBs are galactic in origin. The\u000aselection of these bursts (duplicated in this work in Sample 1) involved a peak\u000acountrate (in counts s-1) uncorrected for aspect. We assert that the peak flux\u000aof a burst is physically more meaningful than peak count-rate. Using, as\u000alimits, the corresponding peak fluxes (in photons cm-2 s-1) for the bursts in\u000athe QL sample, we find an additional 24 bursts, which we include in a new\u000asample (Sample 2). We find that the significance of anisotropy in Sample 2 is\u000amuch less than that of Sample 1, which does not support QL's interpretation of\u000athe anisotropies as being due to a galactic population. To make meaningful\u000astatistical statements regarding isotropy, burst samples must have peak fluxes\u000aabove a minimum flux, set by the requirement that a burst be detectable from\u000aany direction (above the horizon) with respect to GRO, at any detection\u000athreshold at which a burst was observed in that sample. We find that a sample\u000aof such bursts has a marginal (2.6 sigma) deviation from isotropy, which we\u000aconsider insufficient to justify the claim that GRBs are galactic in origin.\u000a

V  A gravitational lens model of the radio quasar B1422+231 is presented which\u000acan account for the image arrangement and approximately for the relative\u000amagnifications. The locations of the principal lensing mass and a more distant\u000asecondary mass concentration were predicted and subsequently luminous galaxies\u000awere found at these locations. This argues against the existence of substantial\u000anumbers of ``dark'' galaxies. The model suggests that if the compact radio\u000asource is intrinsically superluminal then the observed component motions may be\u000aas large as ~100c with image B moving in the opposite direction to images A and\u000aC. The prospects for a measuring the Hubble constant from a model incorporating\u000alens galaxy locations, compact radio source expansion speeds and radio time\u000adelays, if and when these are measured, are briefly assessed.\u000a

V  Many of the current round of experiments searching for anisotropies in the\u000aMBR are confronting the problem of how to disentangle the cosmic signal from\u000acontamination due to galactic and intergalactic foreground sources. Here we\u000ashow how commonly used likelihood function techniques can be generalized to\u000aaccount for foreground. Specifically we set some restrictions on the spectrum\u000aof foreground contamination but allow the amplitude to vary arbitrarily. The\u000alikelihood function thus generalized gives reasonable limits on the MBR\u000aanisotropy which, in some cases, are not much less restrictive than what one\u000awould get from more detailed modeling of the foreground. Furthermore, the\u000alikelihood function is exactly the same as one would obtain by simply\u000aprojecting out foreground contamination and just looking at the reduced data\u000aset. We apply this generalized analysis to the recent medium angle data sets of\u000aACME-HEMT and MAX. The resulting analysis constrains the one free parameter in\u000athe standard cold dark matter theory to be Q=18_-5^+8 microK. This best fit\u000avalue, although in striking agreement with the normalization from COBE, is not\u000aa very good fit, with an overall chi^2/ degree of freedom =208/168. We also\u000aargue against three commonly used methods of dealing with foreground: (i)\u000aignoring it completely; (ii) subtracting off a best fit foreground and treating\u000athe residuals as if uncontaminated; and (iii) culling data which appears to be\u000acontaminated by foreground.\u000a

V  The cosmic microwave anisotropies in a scenario of large scale structure\u000aformation with cold dark matter and texture are discussed and compared with\u000arecent observational results of the COBE satellite. A couple of important\u000astatistical parameters are determined. The fluctuations are slightly non\u000agaussian. The quadrupole anisotropy is $1.5\u005cpm 1.2\u005ctimes 10^{-5}$ and the\u000afluctuations on a angular scale of 10 degrees are $ (3.8\u005cpm 2.6)\u005ctimes\u000a10^{-5}$. The COBE are within about one standard deviation of the typical\u000atexture + CDM model discussed in this paper. Furthermore, we calculate\u000afluctuations on intermediate scales (about 2 degrees) with the result $\u005cDe\u000aT/T(\u005ctheta \u005csim 2^o) = 3.9\u005cpm 0.8)\u005ctimes 10^{-5}$. Collapsing textures are\u000amodeled by spherically symmetric field configurations. This leads to\u000auncertainties of about a factor of~2.\u000a

V  We investigate particle laws of motion derived from nonstandard kinetic\u000aactions of a special form. We are guided by a phenomenological scheme--the\u000amodified dynamics (MOND)--that imputes the mass discrepancy observed in\u000agalactic systems to a departure from Newtonian dynamics below a certain\u000aacceleration scale a0. In the limit a0 goes to 0 the theory goes to Newtonian\u000adynamics. In the opposite limit the action becomes proportional to 1/a0.\u000aGalilei-invariant such theories must be strongly non-local; this is a blessing,\u000aas such theories need not suffer from the illnesses that are endemic to\u000ahigher-derivative theories. We discuss the possibility that such a modified law\u000aof motion is an effective theory resulting from the elimination of degrees of\u000afreedom pertaining to the universe at large (the near equality a0=cH0 being a\u000atrace of that connection). A virial relation for bounded trajectories is\u000aderived. Exact solutions are obtained for circular orbits, which pertain to\u000arotation curves of disk galaxies. We also explore, in passing, theories that\u000adepart from the conventional\u000a  Newtonian dynamics for very low frequencies. The present formulation\u000acontrasts, on important accounts, with earlier, modified-gravity formulations.\u000a

The choice of these molecules\u000ais determined by the simple chemistry and the predicted high abundance of the\u000areactants leading to their formation. The isotopically substituted species\u000a(isotopomers), H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ and H$^{13}$CN, were observed in order to\u000adetermine, whenever possible, the optical thickness of the main species. The\u000amost abundant isotopomers were found in almost all the sources (detection rate\u000a70-90\u005c%). Those sources which exhibited the strongest signals were also\u000asearched for the $^{13}$C isotopomers. H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ was found in one dark\u000acloud and around three Herbig Ae/Be stars, while H$^{13}$CN around only one\u000astar. The column densities for each species and the physical conditions of the\u000aobjects were derived whenever the observational data allowed it.\u000a

V  We describe an attempt to reconstruct the initial conditions for the\u000aformation of cosmological large-scale structure. The power spectrum of the\u000aprimordial fluctuations is affected by bias, nonlinear evolution and\u000aredshift-space distortions, but we show how these effects can be corrected for\u000aanalytically. Using eight independent datasets, we obtain excellent agreement\u000ain the estimated linear power spectra given the following conditions. First,\u000athe relative bias factors for Abell clusters, radio galaxies, optical galaxies\u000aand IRAS galaxies must be in the ratios 4.5:1.9:1.3:1. Second, the data require\u000aredshift-space distortion: $\u005cOmega^{0.6}/b_{\u005css I}\u000a  = 1.0 \u005cpm 0.2$. Third, low values of $\u005cOmega$ and bias are disfavoured. The\u000ashape of the spectrum is extremely well described by a CDM transfer function\u000awith an apparent value of the fitting parameter $\u005cOmega h =0.25$. Tilted models\u000apredict too little power at 100 Mpc wavelengths.\u000a

V  : From the epoch of recombination $(z\u005capprox 10^3)$ till today, the typical\u000adensity contrasts have grown by a factor of about $10^6$ in a Friedmann\u000auniverse with $\u005cOmega=1$. However, during the same epoch the typical\u000agravitational potential has grown only by a factor of order unity. We present\u000atheoretical arguments explaining the origin of this approximate constancy of\u000agravitational potential. This fact can be exploited to provide a new, powerful,\u000aapproximation scheme to study the formation of nonlinear structures in the\u000auniverse. The essential idea of this method is to evolve the initial\u000adistribution of particles using a gravitational potential frozen in time\u000a(Frozen Potential Approximation). This approximation provides valuable insight\u000ainto understanding various features of nonlinear evolution; for example, it\u000aprovides a simple explanation as to why pancakes remain thin during the\u000aevolution even in the absence of any artificial, adhesion-like, damping terms.\u000aWe compare the trajectories of particles in various approximations. We also\u000adiscuss a few applications of the frozen potential approximation.\u000a

We analyze two CHDM simulations with $b =1.5$\u000a(COBE normalization). We also compare them with CDM simulations with $b=1.5$\u000aand $b=1$. We evaluate high-order correlation functions and the\u000avoid-probability-function (VPF). Correlation functions are obtained both from\u000acounts in cells and counts of neighbors. The analysis is made for DM particles\u000aand for galaxies, identified as massive halos in the evolved density field.

Galaxies\u000afollow hierarchical scaling far more closely, with coefficients S_3=2.5 and\u000aS_4=7.5, in general agreement with observational results, just marginally\u000aaffected by redshift distortions and on the choices for the initial spectra.\u000aThe hierarchical scaling of galaxy clustering is confirmed by the VPF analysis\u000aand in all the cases considered a good agreement with observational results is\u000aobtained.\u000a

V  In QCD with two flavors of massless quarks, the chiral phase transition is\u000aplausibly in the same universality class as the classical four component\u000aHeisenberg antiferromagnet. Therefore, renormalization group techniques\u000adeveloped in the study of phase transitions can be applied to calculate the\u000acritical exponents which characterize the scaling behaviour of universal\u000aquantities near the critical point. This approach to the QCD phase transition\u000ahas implications both for lattice gauge theory and for heavy ion collisions.\u000aFuture lattice simulations with longer correlation lengths will be able to\u000ameasure the various exponents and the equation of state for the order parameter\u000aas a function of temperature and quark mass which we describe. In a heavy ion\u000acollision, the consequence of a long correlation length would be large\u000afluctuations in the number ratio of neutral to charged pions. Unfortunately, we\u000ashow that this phenomenon will not occur if the plasma stays close to\u000aequilibrium as it cools. If the transition is far out of equilibrium and can be\u000amodelled as a quench, it is possible that large volumes of the plasma with the\u000apion field correlated will develop, with dramatic phenomenological\u000aconsequences. }\u000a

V  Recent measurements of gamma rays from the powerful quasar 3C273 by the\u000aCompton Gamma Ray Observatory show that a powerful cosmic accelerator must be\u000aoperating. In this paper the evidence for proton acceleration is collected with\u000athe result that (i) the gamma ray spectrum should flatten slightly above a few\u000aGeV and that (ii) high energy neutrinos from the decay of photomesons are\u000adifficult to observe, although the power carried by these particles is as large\u000aas the gamma ray power. However, the power is concentrated at energies in the\u000aEeV range, whereas in the TeV-PeV range neutrinos from pp and p$\u005calpha$\u000acollisions dominate due to their steeper spectrum. Consequently, the flux of\u000acosmic neutrinos from flat spectrum radio sources such as 3C273 in the energy\u000arange relevant for proposed underwater or underice detectors could be much\u000alower than inferred from assuming the same spectrum for gamma rays and\u000aneutrinos.\u000a

V  The dissipative infall of gas during the formation of a galaxy modifies the\u000adensity profile and shape of the dark halo. Gas dissipates energy radiatively\u000aand sinks to the center of the dark halo forming the luminous part of a galaxy.\u000aThe resulting central density enhancement can alter the halo's orbital\u000adistribution. We simulate dissipative infall inside of an initially triaxial\u000aN-body dark halo by slowly growing a potential in the center of the particle\u000adistribution. The dark halo transforms from a prolate-triaxial halo ($T \u005csim\u000a0.8$) to an oblate-triaxial halo ($T \u005csim 0.5$) while approximately preserving\u000athe flattening ($c/a \u005csim 0.5$). The main implication is that dark halos are\u000arounder and more oblate than previous predictions of purely collisionless\u000asimulations with the new constraint that $b/a \u005cgapp 0.7$. At the same time, the\u000adistribution of intrinsic flattenings of dark halos ($\u005clangle c/a \u005crangle =\u000a0.5$, $\u005clangle (c/a)^2 \u005crangle ^{1/2} = 0.15$) is preserved during the period\u000aof baryonic infall. The oval distortions of disk galaxies should therefore be\u000aslightly less than original predictions from collisionless dark halos. The\u000apredicted distribution of shapes for dark halos from cosmological N-body\u000asimulations is in better agreement with distribution of ellipticities of\u000aelliptical galaxies if we assume all halos and galaxies become oblate-triaxial\u000ain response to baryonic dissipation.

V  The four operating solar neutrino experiments confirm the hypothesis that the\u000aenergy source for solar luminosity is hydrogen fusion. However, the measured\u000arate for each of the four solar neutrino experiments differs significantly (by\u000afactors of 2.0 to 3.5) from the corresponding theoretical prediction that is\u000abased upon the standard solar model and the simplest version of the standard\u000aelectroweak theory. If standard electroweak theory is correct, the energy\u000aspectrum for \u005cb8 neutrinos created in the solar interior must be the same (to\u000aone part in $10^5$) as the known laboratory \u005cb8 neutrino energy spectrum.\u000aDirect comparison of the chlorine and the Kamiokande experiments, both\u000asensitive to \u005cb8 neutrinos, suggests that the discrepancy between theory and\u000aobservations depends upon neutrino energy, in conflict with standard\u000aexpectations. Monte Carlo studies with 1000 implementations of the standard\u000asolar model confirm that the chlorine and the Kamiokande experiments cannot be\u000areconciled unless new weak interaction physics changes the shape of the \u005cb8\u000aneutrino energy spectrum. The results of the two gallium solar neutrino\u000aexperiments strengthen the conclusion that new physics is required and help\u000adetermine a relatively small allowed region for the MSW neutrino parameters.\u000a

V  Daily monitoring of PKS 2155-304 with the IUE satellite throughout November\u000a1991 has revealed dramatic, large-amplitude, rapid variations in the\u000aultraviolet flux of this BL Lac object. Many smaller, rapid flares are\u000asuperimposed on a general doubling of the intensity. During the five-day period\u000awhen sampling was roughly continuous, the rapid flaring had an apparent\u000aquasi-periodic nature, with peaks repeating every ~0.7 days. The short- and\u000along-wavelength ultraviolet light curves are well correlated with each other,\u000aand with the optical light curve deduced from the Fine Error Sensor (FES) on\u000aIUE. The formal lag is zero but the cross-correlation if asymmetric in the\u000asense that the shorter wavelength emission leads the longer. The ultraviolet\u000aspectral shape varies a small but significant amount. The correlation between\u000aspectral shape and intensity is complicated; an increase in intensity is\u000aassociated with spectral hardening, but lags behind the spectral change by ~1\u000aday. The sign of the correlation is consistent with the nonthermal acceleration\u000aprocesses expected in relativistic plasmas, so that the present results are\u000aconsistent with relativistic jet models, which can also account for\u000aquasi-periodic flaring. In contrast, currently proposed accretion disk models\u000aare stronly ruled out by the simultaneous optical and ultraviolet variability.\u000a

V  All direct measurements of peculiar velocities of glaxies assume the Hubble\u000alaw at low redshifts. However, it has been suggested by Segal et al (1993) that\u000athe correlation of redshifts and fluxes in a complete sample of IRAS galaxies\u000ais inconsistent with the Hubble law, and instead implies that redshifts are\u000aproportional to the square of distance at small redshift. The essence of the\u000aargument is that the luminosity function of galaxies itself can be used as a\u000adistance indicator. We examine this possibility critically using a variety of\u000astatistical tests, and conclude that the data do indeed support the Hubble law,\u000aalthough the strongest arguments require the assumption of small density\u000acontrasts on large scales. We identify several possible pitfalls in such an\u000aanalysis which could lead one to an erroneous conclusion.\u000a

V  The Doppler shifts of optical emission lines which have been scattered by\u000asurrounding dust and electrons can provide useful information about the\u000akinematics, geometry and physical conditions of astrophysical flows. In\u000aprinciple, the scatterers can provide views of the line-emitting gas from\u000adifferent directions, allowing the 3-d velocity field of the emitting gas to be\u000adetermined and revealing sources which are hidden from direct view.\u000aUnfortunately, as in a Hall of Mirrors, the resultant multiple images can be\u000aconfusing and hard to interpret. In general, the scattering geometry will be\u000aunknown, which makes it difficult to disentangle the effect of the motion of\u000athe scatterers from that of the motion of the emitting source. In this\u000asituation, spectropolarimetric observations can be a great help, since the\u000ascattered light will be partially polarised to a degree dependent on the angle\u000aof scattering and on the details of the scattering process. Analysis of the\u000apolarisation profiles of the scattered emission lines can then determine the\u000arelative orientation and velocity of the source and the scatterers. Such\u000atechniques are applied to the upstream scattered emission lines in the HH 1\u000ajet, where it is shown that spectropolarimetric measurements would allow an\u000aindependent determination of the bowshock velocity with respect to the upstream\u000amatter, which would test ``multiple outburst'' models of the jet.\u000a

V  In this paper, we study the evolution of a relativistic, superhorizon-sized\u000avoid embedded in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. We numerically solve\u000athe spherically symmetric general relativistic equations in comoving,\u000asynchronous coordinates. Initially, the fluid inside the void is taken to be\u000ahomogeneous and nonexpanding. In a radiation- dominated universe, we find that\u000aradiation diffuses into the void at approximately the speed of light as a\u000astrong shock---the void collapses. We also find the surprising result that the\u000acosmic collapse time (the $1^{\u005crm st}$-crossing time) is much smaller than\u000apreviously thought, because it depends not only on the radius of the void, but\u000aalso on the ratio of the temperature inside the void to that outside. If the\u000aratio of the initial void radius to the outside Hubble radius is less than the\u000aratio of the outside temperature to that inside, then the collapse occurs in\u000aless than the outside Hubble time. Thus, superhorizon-sized relativistic void\u000amay thermalize and homogenize relatively quickly. These new simulations revise\u000athe current picture of superhorizon-sized void evolution after first-order\u000ainflation.\u000a

V  A Lagrangian relativistic approach to the non--linear dynamics of\u000acosmological perturbations of an irrotational collisionless fluid is\u000aconsidered. Solutions are given at second order in perturbation theory for the\u000arelevant fluid and geometric quantities and compared with the corresponding\u000aones in the Newtonian approximation. Specifically, we compute the density, the\u000avolume expansion scalar, the shear, the ``electric" part, or tide, and the\u000a``magnetic" part of the Weyl tensor. The evolution of the shear and the tide\u000abeyond the linear regime strongly depends on the ratio of the characteristic\u000asize of the perturbation to the cosmological horizon distance. For\u000aperturbations on sub--horizon scales the usual Newtonian approximation applies,\u000aat least at the considered perturbative order; on super--horizon scales,\u000ainstead, a new picture emerges, which we call ``silent universe", as each fluid\u000aelement evolves independently of the environment, being unable to exchange\u000asignals with the surrounding matter through either sound waves or gravitational\u000aradiation. For perturbations inside the Hubble radius particular attention is\u000apaid in singling out non--local effects during the non--linear evolution of\u000afluid elements. These non--local effects are shown to be carried by a traceless\u000aand divergenceless tensor, contained in the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor,\u000awhich is dynamically generated as soon as the system evolves away from the\u000alinear regime.\u000a

V  In this paper I consider the nonlinear evolution of a rare density\u000afluctuation in a random density field with Gaussian fluctuations, and I\u000arigorously show that it follows the spherical collapse dynamics applied to its\u000amean initial profile. This result is valid for any cosmological model and is\u000aindependent of the shape of the power spectrum. In the early stages of the\u000adynamics the density contrast of the fluctuation is seen to follow with a good\u000aaccuracy the form $$\u005cdelta=(1-\u005cdelta_L/1.5)^{-1.5}-1,$$ where $\u005cdelta_L$ is the\u000alinearly extrapolated overdensity. I then investigate the validity domain of\u000athe rare event approximation in terms of the parameter $\u005cnu=\u005cdelta_L/\u005csigma$\u000agiving the initial overdensity scaled by the rms fluctuation at the same mass\u000ascale, and find that it depends critically on the shape of the power spectrum.\u000aWhen the power law index $n$ is lower than $-1$ the departure from the\u000aspherical collapse is expected to be small, at least in the early stages of the\u000adynamics, and even for moderate values of $\u005cnu$ ($\u005cvert\u005cnu\u005cvert\u005cge 2$).\u000aHowever, for $n\u005cge -1$ and whatever the value of $\u005cnu$, the dynamics seems to\u000abe dominated by the small--scale fluctuations and the subsequent evolution of\u000athe peak may not be necessarily correlated to its initial overdensity. I\u000adiscuss the implications of these results for the nonlinear dynamics and the\u000aformation of astrophysical objects.\u000a

V  I report on controlled comparison of gravitational approximation schemes\u000alinear/lognormal/adhesion/frozen-flow/Zel'dovich(ZA) and ZA's second--order\u000ageneralization. In the last two cases we also created new versions of the\u000aapproximation by truncation, i.e., by finding an optimum smoothing window (see\u000atext) for the initial conditions. The Zel'dovich approximation, with optimized\u000ainitial smoothing, worked extremely well. Its second-order generalization was\u000aslightly better. The success of our best-choice was a result of the treatment\u000aof the phases of nonlinear Fourier components. The adhesion approximation\u000aproduced the most accurate nonlinear power spectrum and density distribution,\u000abut its phase errors suggest mass condensations were moved somewhat\u000aincorrectly. Due to its better reproduction of the mass density distribution\u000afunction and power spectrum, adhesion might be preferred for some uses. We\u000arecommend either n-body simulations or our modified versions of ZA, depending\u000aon the purpose. Modified ZA can rapidly generate large numbers of realizations\u000aof model universes with good accuracy down to galaxy group (or smaller) mass\u000ascales.\u000a

We\u000ainvestigate the constraints placed on such scenarios by the \u005ciras survey.\u000aWhilst an extrapolation of the mass function of visible disk stars makes it\u000aunlikely that brown dwarfs comprise all of the proposed disk dark matter, \u005ciras\u000adoes not exclude brown dwarfs providing the dark matter in our own halo or a\u000acosmological background. Neither does it improve on existing dynamical\u000aconstraints on the mass and radius of brown dwarf clusters in our halo. Future\u000asatellites such as \u005ciso and \u005csirtf will either detect brown dwarfs or brown\u000adwarf clusters or else severely constrain their contribution to the dark\u000amatter.\u000a

The finite-size effects\u000acomprising the surface, curvature and even, the Gauss curvature were\u000aconsistently obtained, which shows a converging trend. It is found that there\u000ais a possibility for the formation of metastable strangelets of large mass.

V  Observations indicate that some extended outer disks have a sharp cut off in\u000athe surface density of neutral hydrogen when this approaches the value of $\u005csim\u000a2\u005ctimes 10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$. In this paper we model these HI edges as places\u000awhere the ratio of neutral to ionized hydrogen drops rapidly due to ionizing\u000aradiation. We use two different models for the vertical distribution of gas\u000aabove the outer galactic plane: in the first model we derive the density from\u000athe ideal gas law while in the second model we insert a macroscopic pressure\u000aterm and derive the density as for an isothermal slab. We consider two\u000adifferent sources of ionizing photons: external fluxes of different intensity\u000aand spectral index due to quasars, and a monochromatic UV flux due to neutrino\u000adecays. We find that galaxies which have a smaller gas scale height should show\u000aouter HI disks to a lower column density and smoother HI edges. The sharpness\u000aof the HI-HII transition and the total column density at which the medium is\u000a50$\u005c%$ ionized, are strongly correlated. We present several model fits to the\u000aHI sharp edge observed in M33. If today's UV background is dominated by\u000aattenuated quasar light, which gives $\u005csim 10^{-14}$ H ionizations s$^{-1}$, a\u000alarge gas scale height or equivalently a nearly spherical halo is preferred. If\u000aionizing photons from decaying neutrinos are responsible for the sharp edge, a\u000aflat dark matter halo, is required.\u000a

V  SHORTENED ABSTRACT: We present numerical investigations designed to\u000acritically test models of the origin of the Magellanic Stream. The most\u000adeveloped model is the tidal model which fails to reproduce several of its\u000acharacteristic properties. We suggest an alternative model for the origin of\u000athe Stream which can explain all of its observed features and dynamics, as well\u000aas provide a strong constraint on the distribution of gas within the halo of\u000athe Milky Way. We propose that the Stream consists of material which was\u000aram-pressure stripped from the Magellanic System during its last passage\u000athrough an extended ionized disk of the Galaxy. This collision took place some\u000a500 million years ago at a galacto-centric distance of about 65 kpc, and swept\u000a$\u005csim 20$\u005c% of the least bound HI into the Stream. The gas with the lowest\u000acolumn density lost the most orbital angular momentum, and is presently at the\u000atip of the Stream, having fallen to a distance of $\u005csim 20$ kpc from the Milky\u000aWay attaining a negative velocity of 200 \u005ckms. To prevent the stripped material\u000afrom leading the Magellanic Clouds and attaining too large an infall velocity,\u000awe postulate the existence of an extended dilute halo of diffuse ionized gas\u000asurrounding the Milky Way. If the halo gas is at the virial temperature of the\u000apotential well of the Milky Way, its thermal emission would contribute $\u005csim$\u000a40\u005c% of the observed diffuse background radiation in the 0.5-1.0 keV (M) band,\u000aconsistent with recent ROSAT measurements as well as pulsar dispersion\u000ameasures.

V  We introduce an approximation to calculate the gravitational radiation\u000aproduced by the collision of true-vacuum bubbles that is simple enough to allow\u000athe simulation of a phase transition by the collision of hundreds of bubbles.\u000aThis ``envelope approximation'' neglects the complicated ``overlap'' regions of\u000acolliding bubbles and follows only the evolution of the bubble walls. The\u000aapproximation accurately reproduces previous results for the gravitational\u000aradiation from the collision of two scalar-field vacuum bubbles. Using a bubble\u000anucleation rate given by $\u005cGamma = \u005cGamma_0 e^{\u005cbeta t}$, we simulate a phase\u000atransition by colliding 20 to 200 bubbles; the fraction of vacuum energy\u000areleased into gravity waves is $E_{\u005crm GW}/E_{\u005crm vac} = 0.06(H/\u005cbeta)^2$ and\u000athe peak of the spectrum occurs at $\u005comega_{\u005crm max}=1.6\u005cbeta$ ($H^2=8\u005cpi G\u005crho\u000a/3$ is the Hubble constant associated with the false-vacuum phase). The\u000aspectrum is very similar to that in the two-bubble case, except that the\u000aefficiency of gravity-wave generation is about five times higher, presumably\u000adue to the fact that a given bubble collides with many others. Finally, we\u000aconsider two further ``statistical'' approximations, where the gravitational\u000aradiation is computed as an incoherent sum over individual bubbles weighted by\u000athe distribution of bubble sizes. These approximations provide reasonable\u000aestimates of the gravitational-wave spectrum with far less computation.\u000a

V  Using a non-parametric procedure developed by Kaiser \u005c& Squires (1993), we\u000aanalyse the statistical image distortions of faint field galaxies to $I\u005cls25.5$\u000ain two distant X-ray luminous clusters 1455+22 ($z_{cl}=0.26$) and 0016+16\u000a($z_{cl}=0.55$) to derive two dimensional projected mass distributions for the\u000aclusters. The mass maps of 1455+22 and 0016+16 are presented at effective\u000aresolutions of 135 kpc and 200 kpc respectively (for $H_o$=50 kms sec$^{-1}$\u000aMpc$^{-1}$, $q_o=0.5$) with a mean signal to noise per resolution element of 17\u000aand 14. We compare our 2-D mass distributions on scales up to $\u005csim$1 Mpc with\u000athose defined by the spatial distribution of colour-selected cluster members\u000aand from deep high resolution X-ray images of the hot intracluster gas. Despite\u000athe different cluster morphologies, one being cD-dominated and the other not,\u000ain both cases the form of the mass distribution derived from the lensing signal\u000ais strikingly similar to that traced by both the cluster galaxies and the hot\u000aX-ray gas. We find some evidence for a greater central concentration of dark\u000amatter with respect to the galaxies. The overall similarity between the\u000adistribution of total mass and that defined by the baryonic components presents\u000aa significant new observational constraint on the nature of dark matter and the\u000aevolutionary history of rich clusters.\u000a

Included are the\u000aeffects of survey geometry, errors in the distance measurements, clustering\u000aproperties of the sample, and different assumed power spectra. We consider the\u000apower spectrum calculated from the IRAS--QDOT survey, as well as spectra from\u000ahot $+$ cold and standard cold dark matter models. We find that sparse sampling\u000aand clustering can lead to an unexpectedly large bulk flow, even in a very deep\u000asurvey. Our results suggest that the expected bulk motion is inconsistent with\u000athat reported by Lauer and Postman at the $90-94\u005c%$ confidence level.\u000a

The radiative\u000adissipation is similar to the famous Compton drag acting upon ``cold'' thermal\u000aparticles in a relativistic bulk flow. Highly relativistic protons induce\u000aanisotropic showers raining electromagnetic power down onto the putative\u000aaccretion disk. Thus, the radiative signature of hot hadronic jets is x-ray\u000airradiation of cold thermal matter. The synchrotron radio emission of the\u000aaccelerated electrons is self-absorbed due to the strong magnetic fields close\u000ato the magnetic nozzle.\u000a

V  As long as there is no distance indicator to the sources of gamma-ray bursts\u000aall possible sources which are isotropically distributed should remain under\u000aconsideration. This is why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list. We use\u000athe available data on the bursts' distribution of (the BATSE catalogue), and\u000athe Catalogue of Cometary Orbits by Marsden and Williams (1992) to investigate\u000awhether there is any observational indication for correlations between the\u000aangular distributions of bursts and comets' aphelia, assuming that the\u000adistribution of aphelia direction reflect, at least to some extent, true\u000avariations in the column density of the Oort cloud. We also apply the V/V_{max}\u000atest to both distributions. We have performed a variety of statistical tests (a\u000aKolmogorov-Smirnov test for the distributions in galactic latitude, a $\u005cchi^2$\u000atest for the spherical multiple moments, and a 2-D cross-correlation analysis),\u000aincluding testing sub-samples for isolating the effect of possible\u000aobservational biases. These tests imply that it is unlikely that the two\u000adistributions agree, but the statistical significance is not sufficient for\u000aruling out any connection with complete confidence. We performed Monte-Carlo\u000asimulations which show that only when the number of bursts exceeds $\u005csim 800$\u000ait is possible to rule out a correlation between the angular distributions.\u000aCurrently, it is only the combination of these tests with the large\u000adisagreement found for the V/V_{max} parameter which makes the Oort cloud of\u000acomets unlikely to be related to gamma-ray bursts.\u000a

V  The COBE satellite has discovered anisotropies in the cosmic microwave\u000abackground (CMB) consistent with a scale invariant spectrum of density\u000aperturbations. As reviewed in this lecture, topological defect models of\u000astructure formation generically produce such a spectrum. We give a summary of\u000athe cosmic string and global texture models, focusing on distinct observational\u000asignatures in large-scale structure surveys and in the microwave background. It\u000ais shown that the amplitude of the CMB quadrupole detected by COBE is in good\u000aagreement with the predictions of the cosmic string model.\u000a

V  Most of the mass density in the Universe---and in the halo of our own\u000agalaxy---exists in the form of dark matter. Overall, the contribution of\u000aluminous matter (in stars) to the mass density of the Universe is less than\u000a1\u005c%; primordial nucleosynthesis indicates that baryons contribute between 1\u005c%\u000aand 10\u005c% of the critical density ($0.01h^{-2}\u005cla \u005cOmega_B\u005cla 0.02h^{-2}$; $h=$\u000athe Hubble constant in units of $100\u005ckms\u005cMpc^{-1}$); and other evidence\u000aindicates that the total mass density is at least 10\u005c% of critical density, and\u000alikely much greater. If the universal density is as low as 10\u005c% of the critical\u000adensity there may be but one kind of dark matter. More likely, the universal\u000adensity is greater than 10\u005c%, and there are two kinds of dark matter, and thus\u000atwo dark matter problems: In what form does the baryonic dark matter exist? and\u000aIn what form does the nonbaryonic dark matter exist? The MACHO and EROS\u000acollaborations have presented evidence for the microlensing of stars in the LMC\u000aby $10^{-1\u005cpm 1}M_\u005codot$ dark objects in the halo of our own galaxy and may\u000awell have solved {\u005cit one} of the dark matter puzzles by identifying the form\u000aof the baryonic dark matter.\u000a

V  We propose the zero-point of the cluster-cluster correlation function as a\u000asensitive test for the shape of the power spectrum of initial fluctuations. It\u000ais now possible to go beyond the power law description to measure the point at\u000awhich the correlation function becomes zero. Four independent measurements\u000aindicate that the zero point, $r_0$, should be in the range (40-60)$h^{-1}$Mpc.\u000aThe large value of $r_0$ at which the zero-point occurs rules out conventional\u000aCDM models independently of the assumed amplitude. Models with $\u005cOmega < 0.25$\u000ashould be rejected because they predict too large $r_0$. If the age of the\u000aUniverse is assumed to be larger than 15 Gyr, models with either $\u005cOmega<0.5$\u000aor $h> 0.55$ are rejected. We present the results of numerical simulations of\u000aclusters in an $\u005cOmega=1$ cosmological model with a mixture of cold plus hot\u000adark matter (CHDM). The correlation function we determined for the simulated\u000aclusters has a zero-point, $r_0=55h^{-1}$Mpc that accurately matches the zero\u000apoint of the observed function.\u000a

V  Large-scale structures, observed today, are generally believed to have grown\u000afrom random, small-amplitude inhomogeneities, present in the early Universe. We\u000ainvestigate how gravitational instability drives the distribution of these\u000afluctuations away from the initial state, assumed to be Gaussian. Using second\u000aorder perturbation theory, we calculate the skewness factor, $S_3 \u005cequiv\u000a\u005clangle \u005cdelta^3 \u005crangle \u005c, /\u005c, \u005clangle \u005cdelta^2 \u005crangle^2$. Here the brackets,\u000a$\u005clangle \u005cldots \u005crangle$, denote an ensemble average, and $\u005cdelta$ is the\u000adensity contrast field, smoothed with a low pass spatial filter. We show that\u000a$S_3$ decreases with the slope of the fluctuation power spectrum; it depends\u000aonly weakly on $\u005cOmega$, the cosmological density parameter. We compare\u000aperturbative calculations with N-body experiments and find excellent agreement\u000aover a wide dynamic range. If galaxies trace the mass, measurements of $S_3$\u000acan be used to distinguish models with Gaussian initial conditions from their\u000anon-Gaussian alternatives.\u000a

V  The cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies have turned out to\u000arepresent one of the most stringent 'bottle necks' for scenarios of large scale\u000astructure formation. As a possibility to relax this constraint, it has been\u000aproposed that early reionization can damp CMB fluctuations on small scales due\u000ato photon diffusion in the ionized plasma. As an example, I investigate the\u000arecently proposed scenario with cold dark matter (CDM) and texture seeds.\u000aThere, an analysis of CMB anisotropies shows that early reionization is a\u000acrucial ingredient for this scenario. Without damping, the small scale\u000aanisotropies would dominate and exceed observed limits. In this paper I present\u000aanalytical and numerical results for the amount of damping due to early\u000areionization for CMB perturbations induced by a collapsing texture.\u000aFurthermore, the spectral distortion of the CMB due to Compton scattering of\u000athe hotter plasma electrons is calculated. Next I discuss the physical\u000aprocesses which lead to a system of coupled ordinary differential equations for\u000athe degree of ionization, the electron temperature and the evolution of the\u000aionizing radiation.\u000a

V  We consider the production of neutrinos in active galactic nuclei (AGN)\u000athrough hadronic cascades. The initial, high energy nucleons are accelerated in\u000aa source above the accretion disk around the central black hole. From the\u000asource, the particles diffuse back to the disk and initiate hadronic cascades.\u000aThe observable output from the cascade are electromagnetic radiation and\u000aneutrinos. We use the observed diffuse background X-ray luminosity, which\u000apresumably results {}from this process, to predict the diffuse neutrino flux\u000aclose to existing limits from the Frejus experiment. The resulting neutrino\u000aspectrum is $E^{-2}$ down to the $\u005cGeV$ region. We discuss modifications of\u000athis scenario which reduce the predicted neutrino flux.\u000a

V  The long-term transitions of the black hole candidate Cygnus X-1 (between the\u000astates gamma_1, gamma_2, and gamma_3) include the occasional appearance of a\u000astrong ~ MeV bump (gamma_1), whose strength appears to be anti-correlated with\u000athe continuum flux (~ 400 keV) due to the Compton upscattering of cold disk\u000aphotons by the inner, hot corona. We develop a self-consistent disk picture\u000athat accounts naturally for these transitions and their corresponding spectral\u000avariations. We argue that the bump is due to the self-Comptonization of\u000abremsstrahlung photons emitted predominantly near the plane of the corona\u000aitself. Our results suggest that a decrease by a factor of approx 2 in the\u000aviscosity parameter alpha is responsible for quenching this bump and driving\u000athe system to the gamma_2 state, whereas a transition from gamma_2 to gamma_3\u000aappears to be induced by an increase of about 25 % in the accretion rate Mdot.\u000aIn view of the fact that most of the transitions observed in this source seem\u000ato be of the gamma_2 to gamma_3 variety, we conclude that much of the long term\u000agamma-ray spectral variability in Cygnus X-1 is due to these small fluctuations\u000ain Mdot. The unusual appearance of the gamma_1 state apparently reflects a\u000achange in the dissipative processes within the disk.\u000a

V  Recent high energy gamma-ray observations (E>100 MeV) of blazar AGN show\u000aemission spectra with no clear upper energy cutoff. AGN, considered to be\u000apossible sources for the highest energy cosmic rays, may have emission\u000aextending well into the VHE (very high energy, E>100 GeV) domain. Because VHE\u000agamma-rays are absorbed by pair production on the intergalactic background\u000aradiation, much of this emission is not visible. Electromagnetic cascades\u000ainitiated by absorbed VHE gamma-rays, however, may be observable. Since the\u000avelocities of e+e- pairs produced in a cascade are likely to be isotropized by\u000aan ambient random magnetic field, extended ``halos'' (R>1 Mpc) of pairs will be\u000aformed around AGN with VHE emission. Cascade radiation from these pair halos is\u000aemitted isotropically and is observable below a few TeV. The halo radiation can\u000abe distinguished by its characteristic variation in spectrum and intensity with\u000aangular distance from the central source. This variation depends weakly on the\u000adetails of the central source model, e.g., the orientation and beaming/opening\u000aangle of an emitting jet. Limiting or determining the intensity of the pair\u000ahalo can thus serve as a model-independent bound on or measure of the VHE power\u000aof AGN. Next-generation Cherenkov telescopes may be able to image a pair halo.\u000a

V  A gravitationally lensed gamma-ray burst (GRB) would appear as multiple\u000abursts with identical light curves, separated in time and differing only by the\u000ascaling of their amplitudes. However, noise may make them difficult to identify\u000aas lensed images. Furthermore, faint, intrinsically similar, yet distinct light\u000acurves may be falsely identified as lensing events. In this paper we develop\u000atwo statistical tests to distinguish noisy burst light curves. We use Fourier\u000aanalysis techniques to analyze the signals for both intrinsic variability and\u000avariability due to noise. We are able to determine the noise level, and we\u000acompare the bursts only at frequency channels that are signal dominated.\u000aUtilizing these methods, we are able to make quantitative statements about\u000awhether two bursts are distinct. We apply these statistics to scaled versions\u000aof two subbursts of GRB 910503--- subbursts previously investigated by\u000aWambsganss (1993) using a different statistical test. We find that our methods\u000aare able to distinguish these bursts at slightly smaller amplitudes than those\u000aat which Wambsganss's method succeeds. We then apply our techniques to\u000a``candidate" lensing events taken from the BATSE catalogue, and we find that\u000anearly all of them, except for the very shortest ones (durations $\u005caproxlt 0.3\u000a~s$), are distinguishable. We therefore expect that a majority of bursts will\u000abe disinguishable from one another.\u000a

We show that the 54 type I ($\u005clog V \u005cle -0.8$) bursts lying in the\u000amiddle brightness range 490 counts $\u005cle B \u005cle$ 1250 counts (corresponding to\u000a1/3 of all type I bursts) exhibit a Galactic dipole moment of $\u005clangle \u005ccos\u000a\u005ctheta \u005crangle = 0.204 \u005cpm 0.079$ {\u005cit and} a deviation of the Galactic\u000aquadrupole moment from 1/3 of $\u005clangle \u005csin^2 b \u005crangle - 1/3 = -0.104 \u005cpm\u000a0.041$. Using Monte Carlo simulations which include the BATSE sky exposure map\u000aand taking into account division of the type I bursts into three equal samples,\u000awe find that the probability by chance of an isotropic distribution of 54\u000abursts exhibiting values of $\u005clangle \u005ccos \u005ctheta \u005crangle$ {\u005cit and} the\u000anegative of $\u005clangle \u005csin^2 b \u005crangle - 1/3$ which equal or exceed the observed\u000avalues is $6.6 \u005ctimes 10^{-5}$.

V  We compare the results for the dynamical evolution of star clusters derived\u000afrom anisotropic gaseous models with the data from N-body simulations of\u000aisolated and one-component systems, each having modest number of stars. The\u000astatistical quality of N-body data was improved by averaging results from many\u000aN-body runs, each with the same initial parameters but with different sequences\u000aof random numbers used to initialize positions and velocities of the particles.\u000aWe study the development of anisotropy, the spatial evolution and energy\u000ageneration by three-body binaries and its N-dependence. We estimate the\u000afollowing free parameters of anisotropic gaseous models: the time scale for\u000acollisional anisotropy decay and the coefficient in the formulae for energy\u000ageneration by three-body binaries. To achieve a fair agreement between N-body\u000aand gaseous models for the core in pre- as well as in post-collapse only the\u000aenergy generation by binaries had to be varied by N. We find that anisotropy\u000ahas considerable influence on the spatial structure of the cluster particularly\u000afor the intermediate and outer regions.\u000a

Models with scale--free power\u000aspectrum $P(k)\u005cpropto k^{\u005c,n}$, with $-1< n \u005cleq 1$, are also considered.

V  The spontaneous breaking of local Lorentz invariance in the early Universe,\u000aassociated with a first order phase transition at a critical time $t_c$,\u000agenerates a large increase in the speed of light and a superluminary\u000acommunication of information occurs, allowing all regions in the Universe to be\u000acausally connected. This solves the horizon problem, leads to a mechanism of\u000amonopole suppression in cosmology and can resolve the flatness problem. After\u000athe critical time $t_c$, local Lorentz (and diffeomorphism) invariance is\u000arestored and light travels at its presently measured speed. The kinematical and\u000adynamical aspects of the generation of quantum fluctuations in the\u000asuperluminary Universe are investigated. A scale invariant prediction for the\u000afluctuation density amplitude is obtained.\u000a

V  In the standard picture of big-bang nucleosynthesis the yields of D, $^3$He,\u000a$^4$He, and $^7$Li only agree with their inferred primordial abundances if the\u000afraction of critical density contributed by baryons is between $0.01h^{-2}$ and\u000a$0.02h^{-2}$ ($h$ is the present value of the Hubble constant in units of\u000a$100\u005ckms\u005cMpc^{-1}$). This is the basis of the very convincing and important\u000aargument that baryons can contribute at most 10\u005c% of critical density and thus\u000acannot close the Universe. Nonstandard scenarios involving decaying\u000aparticles,$^1$ inhomogeneities in the baryon density,$^2$ and even more exotic\u000aideas$^3$ put forth to evade this bound have been largely unsuccessful.$^4$ We\u000asuggest a new way of relaxing the bound: If the tau neutrino has a mass of\u000a$20\u005cMeV-30\u005cMeV$ and lifetime of $200\u005csec -1000\u005csec$, and its decay products\u000ainclude electron neutrinos, the bound to the baryon mass density can be\u000aloosened by a about factor of $10$. The key is the decay-generated electron\u000aantineutrinos: around the time of nucleosynthesis they are captured by protons\u000ato produce neutrons, thereby changing the outcome of nucleosynthesis.\u000aExperiments at $e^\u005cpm$ colliders should soon be sensitive to a tau-neutrino\u000amass in the required range.\u000a

Two types of strings ---\u000aone effectively Abelian and one non-Abelian --- are constructed and the string\u000asolutions are calculated numerically. The non-Abelian string can catalyze\u000abaryon number violation via the ``twisting'' of the scalar field which causes\u000amixing of leptons and quarks in the fermion multiplet. The non-Abelian string\u000ais also found to have the lower energy possibly for the entire range of the\u000aparameters in the theory. Scattering of fermions in the fields of the strings\u000ais analyzed, and the baryon number violation cross section is calculated. The\u000arole of the self-adjoint parameters is discussed and the values are computed.\u000a

V  We present ROSAT PSPC observations of the nova-like, or intermediate polar,\u000aTT Ari and the eclipsing polar DP Leo. Observations of TT Ari were performed as\u000apart of a simultaneous multiwavelength campaign. The X-ray spectrum of TT Ari\u000afrom ROSAT was combined with Ginga observations to suggest the presence of\u000athree distinct emission components: an optically thin plasma, a dominating\u000abremsstrahlung continuum and one or more iron emission lines. Simultaneous and\u000alater IUE observations show modulation in the absorption component of the P\u000aCygni-like CIV line on the spectroscopic period indicating a complex wind\u000astructure. Three eclipses were observed from the DP Leo system with intensity\u000adips, not previously observed, occurring prior to each eclipse. The dips are\u000ainterpreted as the eclipse of the main emission region by an accretion stream\u000avarying in impact position or stream shape with time. The DP Leo spectrum is\u000awell fit by either a 25 eV blackbody or a soft power law. No evidence exists\u000afor accretion onto the stronger magnetic pole and severe limits were placed\u000aupon the flux from any hard bremsstrahlung component. We constrained distances\u000ato this system based upon model fits to the data.\u000a

V  We test the hypothesis that the velocity field derived from Tully-Fisher\u000ameasurements of spiral galaxies, and that derived independently from Dn-sigma\u000ameasurements of ellipticals and S0s, are noisy versions of the same underlying\u000avelocity field. The radial velocity fields are derived using tensor Gaussian\u000asmoothing of radius 1200 km/s. They are compared at grid points near which the\u000asampling by both types of galaxies is proper. This requirement defines a volume\u000aof ~(50 Mpc/h)^3, containing ~10 independent subvolumes, mostly limited by the\u000aavailable ellipticals. The two fields are compared using a correlation\u000astatistic, whose distribution is determined via Monte-Carlo simulations. We\u000afind that the data is consistent with the hypothesis, at the 10% level. We\u000ademonstrate that the failure to reject the correlation is not just a result of\u000athe errors being big, by using the same method to rule out complete\u000aindependence between the fields at the 99.8% level. The zero points of the two\u000adistance indicators are matched by maximizing the correlation between the two\u000avelocity fields. There is a marginal hint that the ellipticals tend to stream\u000aslower than the spirals by ~8%. The correlation reinforced here is consistent\u000awith the common working hypotheses that (a) the derived large-scale velocity\u000afield is real, (b) it has a gravitational origin, and (c) the large-scale\u000avelocities of spirals and ellipticals are hardly biased relative to each other.\u000aOn the other hand, it does not rule out any alternative to gravity where\u000aobjects of all types obtain similar large-scale velocities.\u000a

V  It is shown that the violent relaxation of dissipationless stellar systems\u000aleads to universal de Vaucouleurs profiles only outside 1.5 effective radii\u000a$R_e$. Inside $1.5 R_e$ the surface density profiles depend strongly on the\u000ainitial conditions and are in general not in agreement with the de Vaucouleurs\u000alaw. This result is in contradiction to the observations which show that all\u000aelliptical galaxies have de Vaucouleurs profiles inside $1.5 R_e$ and show\u000astrong deviations outside $1.5 R_e$. The $r^{1/4}$-profiles of E-galaxies are\u000atherefore not a direct result of collisionless violent relaxation and angular\u000amomentum redistribution. It is rather a universal initial density profile which\u000ais required in order to explain the universal structure of E-galaxies. A new\u000amodel for the formation of E-galaxies is presented which assumes that\u000aellipticals and bulges formed from isothermal, gaseous spheres which\u000aaccumulated in the core regions of dark matter halos and condensed into stars\u000athrough a cooling instability. This scenario predicts that early type galaxies\u000atrace directly the core radii and core masses of their dark matter halos,\u000aproviding important information on the nature of the dark matter component in\u000agalaxies.\u000a

V  We propose an experimental scheme to search for galactic halo axions with\u000amass $m_a \u005csim 10^{-3}$eV, which is above the range accessible with cavity\u000atechniques.

The wires\u000acarry a current configuration which produces a static, inhomogeneous magnetic\u000afield $\u005cvec{B}_0(\u005cvec{x})$ within the detector volume. Axions which enter this\u000avolume may convert to photons. We discuss the feasibility of the detector and\u000aits sensitivity.\u000a

V  (substantial changes to section 3.2, otherwise minor) We present an analysis\u000aof the hydrodynamic stability of a cold slab bounded by two accretion shocks.\u000aPrevious numerical work has shown that when the Mach number of the shock is\u000alarge the slab is unstable. Here we show that to linear order both the bending\u000aand breathing modes of such a slab are stable. However, nonlinear effects will\u000atend to soften the restoring forces for bending modes, and when the slab\u000adisplacement is comparable to its thickness this gives rise to a nonlinear\u000ainstability. The growth rate of the instability, above this threshold but for\u000asmall bending angles, is $\u005csim c_sk (k\u005ceta)^{1/2}$, where $\u005ceta$ is the slab\u000adisplacement. When the bending angle is large the slab will contain a local\u000avorticity comparable to $c_s/L$, where $L$ is the slab thickness. We discuss\u000athe implications of this work for gravitational instabilities of slabs.\u000aFinally, we examine the cases of a decelerating slab bounded by a single shock\u000aand a stationary slab bounded on one side by thermal pressure. The latter case\u000ais stable, but appears to be a special case. The former case is subject to a\u000anonlinear overstability driven by deceleration effects. We conclude that shock\u000abounded slabs with a high density compression ratio generically produce\u000asubstructure with a strong local shear, a bulk velocity dispersion like the\u000asound speed in the cold layer and a characteristic scale comparable to the slab\u000athickness.\u000a

V  High resolution maps of the anisotropy of the microwave sky will yield\u000ainvaluable clues as to the mechanisms involved in cosmic structure formation.\u000aOne fundamental question they should answer is whether the fluctuations were\u000aGaussian random noise, as predicted in inflationary models, or were nonGaussian\u000aas in theories based on symmetry breaking and cosmic defects. In the latter\u000acase there is the prospect of obtaining information regarding symmetry breaking\u000aat high energy scales, specifically the homotopy classes $\u005cPi_n$ of the vacuum\u000amanifold. In this paper we report on detailed calculations of the degree scale\u000aanisotropies predicted in the cosmic string, monopole texture and\u000anontopological texture theories of structure formation, emphasising their\u000adistinct character from those predicted by inflation, and the bright prospects\u000afor experimental tests.\u000a

V  Few recent generations of cosmologists have solved non-local newtonian\u000aequations of the gravitational instability in an expanding universe. In this\u000aapproach pancaking is the predominant form of first collapsing objects.\u000aRelativistic counterparts of these equations contain the electric and magnetic\u000aparts of the Weyl tensor. In the linear theory the magnetic part is associated\u000awith gravitational waves. If the magnetic part is ignored, then the newtonian\u000alimit of the relativistic equations is reduced to the closed set of the local\u000aLagrangian equations. Recently this fact drew much attention since the\u000agravitational instability in that form would greatly simplify the study of\u000acosmic structure formation. In particular, the filamentary structure of\u000acollapsing is predicted. In this paper we resolve the contradiction between the\u000anewtonian theory and relativistic version adopted in some recent papers. We\u000ashow that dropping the magnetic part from the basic relativistic equations is\u000a{\u005cit incorrect}. The correct newtonian limit is derived by the $1/c$-expansion\u000aof the GR equations and the Bianchi identities for the Weyl tensor. The last\u000aones begin with $\u005csim 1/c^3$ order, therefore one {\u005cit must} take into account\u000athe magnetic part in the post newtonian order $\u005csim 1/c^3$, which contains\u000anon-local terms, related to the non-local gravitational interaction. For the\u000afirst time we rigorously show that the GR equations with the magnetic part are\u000areduced precisely to the canonic newtonian non-local equations. Thus, the\u000acorrect treatment of the relativistic version of the gravitational instability\u000aresurrects the canonic picture of the structure formation.\u000a

V  The spinning vortex is a stationary generalization of the Nielsen-Olesen\u000avortex involving a linear time dependence of the Goldstone boson. Here we show\u000athat this vortex can be embedded in models with $SU(2)_{global}\u005ctimes\u000aU(1)_{local}$ symmetry. We also map the stability sector in parameter space and\u000ashow that for sufficiently large spinning velocities the vortex is stable for\u000a{\u005cit any} value of the Higgs self coupling parameter $\u005cbeta$. This is a\u000asignificant improvement of stability compared to the semilocal vortex\u000aintroduced by Vachaspati and Achucarro which is stable only for $\u005cbeta<1$. This\u000aresult may have significant implications for electroweak vortices.\u000a

V  We explore the dark matter distribution in ms1224.7+2007 using the\u000agravitational distortion of the images of faint background galaxies. Projected\u000amass image reconstruction reveals a highly significant concentration coincident\u000awith the X-ray and optical location. The concentration is seen repeatably in\u000areconstructions from independent subsamples and the azimuthally averaged\u000atangential shear pattern is also clearly seen in the data. The projected mass\u000awithin a $2.76'$ radius aperture is $\u005csimeq 3.5 \u005ctimes 10^{14} h^{-1}\u000aM_{\u005csun}$. This is $\u005csimeq 3$ times larger than that predicted if mass traces\u000alight with $M/L = 275 h$ as derived from virial analysis. It is very hard to\u000aattribute the discrepancy to a statistical fluctuation, and a further\u000aindication of a significant difference between the mass and the light comes\u000afrom a second mass concentration which is again seen in independent subsamples\u000abut which is not seen at all in the cluster light. We find a mass per galaxy\u000avisible to $I = 22$ of $\u005csimeq 8 \u005ctimes 10^{12}h^{-1}M_{\u005csun}$ which, if\u000arepresentative of the universe, implies a density parameter $\u005cOmega \u005csim 2$. We\u000afind a null detection of any net shear from large-scale structure with a\u000aprecision of 0.9\u005c% per component. This is much smaller than the possible\u000adetection in a recent comparable study, and the precision here is comparable to\u000ato the minimum level of rms shear fluctuations implied by observed large-scale\u000astructure.\u000a

V  Here I examine how to determine the sensitivity of the LIGO, VIRGO, and LAGOS\u000agravitational wave detectors to sources of gravitational radiation by\u000aconsidering the process by which data are analyzed in a noisy detector. By\u000aconstructing the probability that the detector output is consistent with the\u000apresence of a signal, I show how to (1) quantify the uncertainty that the\u000aoutput contains a signal and is not simply noise, and (2) construct the\u000aprobability distribution that the signal parameterization has a certain value.\u000a  From the distribution and its mode I determine volumes $V(P)$ in parameter\u000aspace such that actual signal parameters are in $V(P)$ with probability $P$. If\u000awe are {\u005cem designing} a detector, or determining the suitability of an\u000aexisting detector for observing a new source, then we don't have detector\u000aoutput to analyze but are interested in the ``most likely'' response of the\u000adetector to a signal. I exploit the techniques just described to determine the\u000a``most likely'' volumes $V(P)$ for detector output corresponding to the source.\u000aFinally, as an example, I apply these techniques to anticipate the sensitivity\u000aof the LIGO and LAGOS detectors to the gravitational radiation from a perturbed\u000aKerr black hole.\u000a

V  Using the concept developed in earlier papers, that the cosmic rays originate\u000ain three different main sites, a) the normal supernova explosions into the\u000ainterstellar medium, b) the supernova explosions into a stellar wind, and c)\u000apowerful radio galaxies, we demonstrate in this paper that the spectrum and\u000achemical abundances above $10^4$ GeV can be well understood. Using existing\u000adata on the chemical composition of cosmic rays near TeV energies as a\u000aconstraint, we adjust the parameters of the model to fit the shower size data\u000afrom the Akeno experiment; this is necessary since the derivation of an all\u000aparticle spectrum involves an assumption about the chemical composition of the\u000acosmic rays and so we have to fit the shower size data first and then derive\u000athe all particle spectrum. We present a successful fit to the shower size data\u000awhich allows us to draw three main conclusions: a) For most of the energy range\u000aabove $10^5$ GeV the wind explosions can account for both chemical composition\u000aand spectrum including the knee feature, b) the highest particle energies\u000arequired from the stellar wind explosions imply a magnetic field in the\u000apreexisting stellar wind of at least $3$ Gauss at a fiducial distance of\u000a$10^{14}$ cm, c) the chemical abundances above $10^5$ GeV are dominated by\u000aheavy nuclei such as Neon and higher. The bump observed in the all particle\u000aspectrum below the knee gets weakened with the proper treatment of the energy\u000adependent chemical composition. For high energies we obtain an estimate of the\u000aextragalactic proton flux.\u000a

V  If a substantial fraction of the observed gamma-ray bursts originates within\u000aan extended Galactic halo then their spatial distribution should deviate\u000aslightly from spherical symmetry in a very particular way which involves\u000afeatures both in the bursts' angular and radial distributions.\u000a  This conclusion is based on various reasons which are all related to the\u000apresence and motion of the satellite galaxies around the Galaxy, and is\u000aindependent of the nature and origin of the sources.\u000a  We analyze the spatial distribution of the bursts, according to the BATSE\u000acatalog until March 1992, and argue that the expected signature of an extended\u000aGalactic halo model is indicated by the data. The distance to the faintest\u000abursts in the halo is either $\u005csim130$ Kpc or $\u005csim270$ Kpc.\u000a  Although a signature of a nearby-extragalactic distance scale in the data is\u000avery suggestive, we argue that a comparison with specific models is necessary\u000abefore regarding our findings as a conclusive evidence. If the increasing data\u000asupports our results then gamma-ray bursts may be the first detected\u000amanifestations of nearby intergalactic objects, either primordial or which have\u000aescaped predominantely from our satellite galaxies.\u000a

V  HQM is an optical broad-band photometric monitoring program carried out since\u000aSeptember 1988. We use a CCD camera at the MPIA 1.2$\u005c,$m telescope. Fully\u000aautomatic photometric reduction relative to stars in the frames is done within\u000aa few minutes after each exposure, thus interesting brightness changes can be\u000afollowed in detail. The typical photometric error is 1--2\u005c,\u005c% for a 17.5\u005c,mag\u000aquasar. We here present lightcurves of 14 known violently variable sources and\u000acompare them with literature data. For two BL\u005c,Lac objects, 1E\u005c,1229+645 and\u000a4C\u005c,56.27 (1823+568), this paper is the first variability study. We have also\u000acarried out POSS photometry to obtain indications for variability on a longer\u000atimescale.\u000a

V  Numerical simulations of the evolution of a global topological defect field\u000ahave two characteristic length scales --- one macrophysical, of order the field\u000acorrelation length, and the other microphysical, of order the field width. The\u000asituation currently of most interest to particle cosmologists involves the\u000abehaviour of a GUT-scale defect field at the epoch of decoupling, where the\u000aratio of these scales is typically of order $10^{50}$. Such a ratio is\u000aunrealisable in numerical work, and we consider the approximations which may be\u000aemployed to deal with this. Focusing on the case of global texture we outline\u000athe implementation of the associated algorithms, and in particular note the\u000asubtleties involved in handling texture unwinding events. Comparing the results\u000ain each approach then establishes that, subject to certain constraints on the\u000aminimum grid resolution, the methods described are both robust and consistent\u000awith one another.\u000a

V  We consider the stochastic background of gravity waves produced by\u000afirst-order cosmological phase transitions from two types of sources: colliding\u000abubbles and hydrodynamic turbulence. First we discuss the fluid mechanics of\u000arelativistic spherical combustion. We then numerically collide many bubbles\u000aexpanding at a velocity $v$ and calculate the resulting spectrum of\u000agravitational radiation in the linearized gravity approximation. Our results\u000aare expressed as simple functions of the mean bubble separation, the bubble\u000aexpansion velocity, the latent heat, and the efficiency of converting latent\u000aheat to kinetic energy of the bubble walls. We also estimate the gravity waves\u000aproduced by a Kolmogoroff spectrum of turbulence and find that the\u000acharacteristic amplitude of gravity waves produced is comparable to that from\u000abubble collisions. Finally, we apply these results to the electroweak\u000atransition. Using the one-loop effective potential for the minimal electroweak\u000amodel, the characteristic amplitude of gravity waves produced is $h\u005csimeq\u000a1.5\u005ctimes 10^{-27}$ at a characteristic frequency of $4.1\u005ctimes 10^{-3} \u005c,\u005crm\u000aHz$ corresponding to $\u005cOmega \u005csim10^{-22}$ in gravity waves, far too small for\u000adetection. Gravity waves from more strongly first-order phase transitions,\u000aincluding the electroweak transition in non-minimal models, have better\u000aprospects for detection, though probably not by LIGO.\u000a

This potential is given in terms of a Green\u000afunction for matter density fluctuations of arbitrary amplitude whose time and\u000aspatial dependence are assumed known. The results obtained span both the\u000alinearized and Newtonian limits, and do not explicitly depend on any kind of\u000aaveraging procedure, but make the valid assumption that the global expansion\u000arate is that of a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model.

V  We present a systematic treatment of the linear theory of scalar\u000agravitational perturbations in the synchronous gauge and the conformal\u000aNewtonian (or longitudinal) gauge. We first derive the transformation law\u000arelating the two gauges. We then write down in parallel in both gauges the\u000acoupled, linearized Boltzmann, Einstein and fluid equations that govern the\u000aevolution of the metric perturbations and the density fluctuations of the\u000aparticle species. The particle species considered include cold dark matter\u000a(CDM), baryons, photons, massless neutrinos, and massive neutrinos (a hot dark\u000amatter or HDM candidate), where the CDM and baryon components are treated as\u000afluids while a detailed phase-space description is given to the photons and\u000aneutrinos. The linear evolution equations presented are applicable to any\u000a$\u005cOmega=1$ model with CDM or a mixture of CDM and HDM. Isentropic initial\u000aconditions on super-horizon scales are derived. The equations are solved\u000anumerically in both gauges for a CDM+HDM model with $\u005cOmega_{\u005crm cold}=0.65,$\u000a$\u005cOmega_{\u005crm hot}=0.3$, and $\u005cOmega_{\u005crm baryon}=0.05$. We discuss the\u000aevolution of the metric and the density perturbations and compare their\u000adifferent behaviors outside the horizon in the two gauges. In a companion paper\u000awe integrate the geodesic equations for the neutrino particles in the perturbed\u000aconformal Newtonian background metric computed here. The purpose is to obtain\u000aan accurate sampling of the neutrino phase space for the HDM initial conditions\u000ain $N$-body simulations of the CDM+HDM models.\u000a

V  Recently conformal Weyl gravity has been considered as a candidate\u000aalternative gravity theory. This fourth-order theory is attractive because it\u000ais the only metric theory of gravity which is invariant under local conformal\u000atransformations of the metric. We calculate the primordial light element\u000aabundances in this theory. The major difference {}from the standard cosmology\u000ais that the universe expands far more slowly throughout the nucleosynthesis\u000aepoch. The production of $^4\u005crm{He}$ depends strongly on $\u005ceta$, the ratio of\u000abaryons to photons. For $\u005ceta = 10^{-8}$ the mass fraction of $^4{\u005crm He}$ is\u000a$X_4 \u005csimeq 0.25$ and the number densities relative to hydrogen for $^2{\u005crm\u000aH}$, $^3{\u005crm He}$ and $^7{\u005crm Li}$ are $n(^2{\u005crm H})/n({\u005crm H}) \u005csimeq 9\u005ctimes\u000a10^{-20}$, $n(^3{\u005crm He})/n({\u005crm H})\u005csimeq 4 \u005ctimes 10^{-18}$ and $n(^7{\u005crm\u000aLi})/n({\u005crm H}) \u005csimeq 10^{-13}$. This value of $\u005ceta$ corresponds to a baryon\u000amass density close to the standard model critical density. However, adjusting\u000a$\u005ceta$ to give a reasonable helium yield forces the deuterium and lithium\u000ayields to be small enough that the theory cannot be reconciled with\u000aobservations.\u000a

V  We present a short overview on the extragalactic background radiation from\u000aradio to X-rays, with an eye to the relation to galaxy formation and\u000aemphasizing on astrophysical backgrounds (as opposed to cosmological). As the\u000aradio background, the wealth of data on source counts make possible reliable\u000aestimations of the contribution from extragalactic sources. At 178 MHz we\u000aobtain an antenna temperature of about 22 K, with the 60% of the flux\u000acontributed by radiogalaxies and quasars and the remaining part from sub-mJy\u000aradio sources. At high frequencies the compact sources, generally QSOs,\u000adominate. An intense far-IR/sub-mm background is predicted if a large fraction\u000aof the hard X-ray Background (XRB) comes from starburst galaxies but this might\u000aface problems with the upper limits on the far-IR isotropic flux. To clarify\u000athe problem spectral measurements should be complemented with the analysis of\u000asmall scale anisotropies. The flattening of the QSO counts at B=19.5 suggests\u000athat their contribution to the optical/near-IR background is small in\u000acomparison to that of galaxies. As for the XRB, a consisting picture obtains\u000aconsidering two AGN populations: a "soft X-ray spectrum" population and a "hard\u000aX-ray spectrum" one, mainly contributing to the soft and to the hard XRB\u000arespectively. A third population of extremely absorbed or of reflection\u000adominated AGN could either be the dominant contributor of the XRB above 3 keV.\u000a

V  Relativistic electron-positron winds with strong magnetic fields are\u000aconsidered as a source of radiation for cosmological $\u005cgamma$-ray bursters.\u000aSuch a wind is generated by a millisecond pulsar with a very strong magnetic\u000afield. An electron-positron plasma near the pulsar is optically thick and in\u000aquasi-thermodynamic equilibrium. It is shown that the main part of radiation\u000afrom the pulsar wind is nonthermal and generates in the following way. Kinetic\u000aenergy which is released in the process of deceleration of the neutron star\u000arotation transforms mainly to the magnetic field energy. The magnetic field is\u000afrozen in the outflowing plasma if the distance to the pulsar is smaller than\u000a$\u005csim 10^{13}$ cm. This field transfers the energy from the pulsar environment\u000ato the region outside the $\u005cgamma$-ray photosphere of the electron-positron\u000awind. At a distance of more than $\u005csim 10^{13}$ cm the magnetohydrodynamic\u000aapproximation for the pulsar wind is broken, and intense electromagnetic waves\u000aare generated. The frequency of these waves is equal to the frequency of the\u000apulsar rotation. Outflowing particles are accelerated in the field of intense\u000aelectromagnetic waves to Lorentz factors of the order of $10^6$ and generate\u000anonthermal synchro-Compton radiation. The typical energy of nonthermal photons\u000ais $\u005csim 1$ MeV. A high-energy tail of the $\u005cgamma$-ray spectrum may be up to\u000a$\u005csim 10^4$ MeV. Baryonic matter is ejected occasionally from the pulsar\u000amagnetosphere. The baryonic matter ejection and subsequent suppression of the\u000a$\u005cgamma$-ray emission may be responsible for the time structure of $\u005cgamma$-ray\u000abursts.\u000a

V  Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies that result from quantum\u000afluctuations during inflation are explored and the impact of their ``cosmic\u000avariance'' on the ability to use existing data to probe inflationary models is\u000astudied. We calculate the rms temperature fluctuation, and its cosmic variance,\u000afor a number of experiments and for models with primordial power spectra which\u000arange from $n={1\u005cover 2}$ to $1$. We find: (1) cosmic variance obscures the\u000ainformation which can be extracted, so a comparison of the rms temperature\u000afluctuation on small scales with the COBE result can fix $n$ to only\u000a$\u005capprox\u005cpm 0.2$ at best; (2) measurements of the rms fluctuation on\u000a$1^{\u005ccirc}$ scales may not allow one to unambiguously infer the tensor\u000acontribution to the COBE anisotropy; (3) comparison of this contribution with\u000athe predictions of inflation are ambiguous if the quadrupole anisotropy alone\u000ais utilized. We discuss means for minimizing the uncertainty due to cosmic\u000avariance in comparisons between experiments.\u000a

V  Using redshift samples, we calculate the cross-correlation functions of LSB\u000agalaxies with normal galaxies in complete samples (i.e. CfA and IRAS), which\u000aenables us to compare directly the amplitudes and shapes of the correlation\u000afunctions. For pair separations $r\u005cgs 2\u005cmpc$, we find that the shape is in\u000aagreement with that of the correlation functions for other galaxies. The\u000aamplitudes ($A$) of $\u005cxiab (r)$ are lower than those of the autocorrelation\u000afunctions for the CfA and IRAS samples, with $A_{\u005crm LSB-CfA}:A_{\u005crm\u000aCfA-CfA}\u005capprox 0.4$ and $A_{\u005crm LSB-IRAS}:A_{\u005crm IRAS-IRAS}\u005capprox 0.6$. These\u000aresults suggest that LSB galaxies are imbedded in the same large scale\u000astructure as other galaxies, but are less strongly clustered. This offers the\u000ahope that LSB galaxies may be unbiased tracers of the mass density on large\u000ascales. For $r\u005cls 2\u005cmpc$, the cross-correlation functions are significantly\u000alower than that expected from the extrapolation of $\u005cxiab$ on larger scales,\u000ashowing that the formation and survival of LSB galaxies may be inhibited by\u000ainteraction with neighboring galaxies.\u000a  The model which matches these observations suggests that strong luminosity\u000asegregation in galaxy clustering is not a necessary consequence of biased\u000agalaxy formation, unless the effect of surface brightness is taken in to\u000aaccount. It is also implies a significant mass density in LSB galaxies.\u000a

V  The previous two companion papers demonstrate that slowly varying\u000aperturbations do not result in adiabatic cutoffs and provide a formalism for\u000acomputing the long-term effects of time-dependent perturbations on stellar\u000asystems. Here, the theory is implemented in a Fokker-Planck code and a suite of\u000aruns illustrating the effects of shock heating on globular cluster evolution\u000aare described. Shock heating alone results in considerable mass loss for\u000aclusters with $R_g\u005clta8\u005ckpc$: a concentration $c=1.5$ cluster with $R_g=8\u005ckpc$\u000aloses up to $95\u005c%$ of its initial mass in $15\u005cGyr$. Only those with\u000aconcentration $c\u005clta1.3$ survive disk shocks inside of this radius. Other\u000aeffects, such as mass loss by stellar evolution, will increase this survival\u000abound. Loss of the initial halo together with mass segregation leads to mass\u000aspectral indices, $x$, which may be considerably larger than their initial\u000avalues.\u000a

V  Reanalysis of Einstein IPC data and new observations from the GINGA\u000a  LAC indicate the presence of extended X-ray emission (10-50 kpc) around the\u000astarburst galaxy M82. Here we model this emission by calculating numerical\u000ahydrodynamic simulations of the starburst event to much later times and larger\u000ascales than previously considered. For our models, we adopt a supernova rate of\u000a0.1 ${\u005crm yr}^{-1}$, and an extended low-density static halo that is bound to\u000athe galaxy. There are three stages to the evolution of the wind-blown bubble\u000aand the propagation of the shock front: the bubble expands in an almost uniform\u000adensity disk gas, with a deceleration of the shock front ($t \u005calt $ 3.6 Myr);\u000abreakout from the disk and the upward acceleration of the shock front (3.6\u000a  Myr $\u005calt t \u005calt$ 18 Myr); propagation into the halo, leading to a more\u000aspherical system and shock deceleration (18 Myr $\u005calt t$). For a halo density\u000aof $10^{-3} {\u005crm cm}^{-3}$, the outflow reaches a distance of 40-50 kpc from\u000athe center of the starburst galaxy in 50 Myr. We calculate the time evolution\u000aof the X-ray luminosity and find that the extended starburst emits $3\u005ctimes\u000a10^{39}\u005clcgs$ to $10^{40}\u005clcgs$ in the\u000a  GINGA LAC band and $\u005csim 10^{41}\u005clcgs$ in the Einstein or ROSAT\u000a  HRI band. The degree of the ionization equilibrium in the outflow and its\u000aeffect on the iron K$\u005calpha$ line emission are discussed.\u000a

V  As a basic step for establishing the CO-line Tully-Fisher relation for\u000adistant galaxies, we made a comparative study of HI versus CO line profiles.\u000aTotal line profiles of the CO line emission from 32 galaxies have been compared\u000awith the corresponding HI emission. We found a good correlation between the\u000aprofiles of CO and HI. This strongly supports the thesis that CO can be used in\u000athe Tully-Fisher relation for distant galaxies where HI observations cannot\u000areach. We also argue that CO can be used as an alternative to HI for\u000aun-isolated galaxies such as those in dense cluster of galaxies. Using the\u000aB-magnitudes and a recent calibration of the HI Tully-Fisher relation, we give\u000athe distances for the galaxies derived from the CO-line Tully-Fisher relation\u000aand compare them with the corresponding HI distances.\u000a

V  It is shown that, for a nontrivial radiative decay channel of the 17-keV\u000aneutrino, the photons would distort the microwave background radiation through\u000aionization of the universe. The constraint on the branching ratio of such\u000adecays from COBE measurements is found to be more stringent than that from\u000aother considerations. The limit on the branching ratio in terms of the Compton\u000a$y$ parameter is $B_\u005cgamma < 1.5 \u005ctimes 10^{-7} ({\u005ctau_\u005cnu \u005cover 10^{11}\u000asec})^{0.45} ({y \u005cover 10^{-3}})^{1.11} h^{-1}$ for an $\u005cOmega=1, \u005cOmega_b=0.1$\u000auniverse.\u000a

We show that a dynamical resolution of\u000athe horizon problem requires superluminal expansion (or very close to it) and\u000athat a truly satisfactory resolution of the flatness problem requires entropy\u000aproduction. This implies that a proposed class of adiabatic models in which the\u000aPlanck mass varies by many orders of magnitude cannot fully resolve the\u000aflatness problem. Furthermore, we show that, subject to minimal assumptions,\u000asuch models cannot solve the horizon problem either. Because superluminal\u000aexpansion and entropy production are the two generic features of inflationary\u000amodels, our results suggest that inflation, or something very similar, may be\u000athe only dynamical solution to the horizon and flatness problems.\u000a

V  We begin by enumerating the many processes in gravitation and cosmology where\u000aquantum noise and fluctuations play an active role such as particle creation,\u000agalaxy formation and entropy generation. Using the influence functional we\u000afirst explain the origin and nature of noise in quantum systems interacting\u000awith an environment at a finite temperature. With linear coupling to nonohmic\u000abaths or at low temperatures, colored noise and nonlocal dissipation would\u000aappear and for nonlinear coupling multiplicative noise is generally expected.\u000aWe derive a generalized fluctuation- dissipation relation for these systems.\u000aThen using a model of quantum Brownian motion in a bath of parametric\u000aoscillators, we show how noise and dissipation can be related to the Bogolubov\u000acoefficients of parametric amplification, which in the second-quantized sense,\u000adepicts cosmological particle creation in a dynamic background. We then\u000acalculate the influence functional and study the noise characteristics of\u000aquantum fields as probed by a particle detector. As examples, we show that an\u000auniformly- accelerated observer in flat space or an inertial observer in an\u000aexponentially expanding (de Sitter) universe would see a thermal particle\u000aspectrum, recovering the well-known results of Unruh and Gibbons and Hawking ,\u000aas inspired by the Hawking effect in black holes. We show how this method can\u000abe effectively used for treating the backreaction of particle creation and\u000aother quantum field processes on the\u000a

V  We study nonlinear wave phenomena in self-gravitating fluid systems, with a\u000aparticular emphasis on applications to molecular clouds. This paper presents\u000aanalytical results for one spatial dimension. We show that a large class of\u000aphysical systems can be described by theories with a ``charge density''\u000a$q(\u005crho)$; this quantity replaces the density on the right hand side of the\u000aPoisson equation for the gravitational potential. We use this formulation to\u000aprove general results about nonlinear wave motions in self-gravitating systems.\u000aWe show that in order for stationary waves to exist, the total charge (the\u000aintegral of the charge density over the wave profile) must vanish. This\u000a``no-charge'' property for solitary waves is related to the capability of a\u000asystem to be stable to gravitational perturbations for arbitrarily long\u000awavelengths. We find necessary and sufficient conditions on the charge density\u000afor the existence of solitary waves and stationary waves. We then apply these\u000aresults to study nonlinear waves in Jeans-type theories, Yukawa theories, and a\u000apseudo-two-dimensional treatment. We study the allowed types of wave behavior\u000afor all of these models. Finally, we discuss the implications of this work for\u000amolecular cloud structure.\u000a

V  A recent re-analysis of Einstein data, and new ROSAT observations, have\u000arevealed the presence of at least two components in the X-ray spectra of X-ray\u000afaint early-type galaxies: a relatively hard component (kT>1.5 keV), and a very\u000asoft component (kT\u005csim 0.2-0.3 keV). We address the problem of the nature of\u000athe very soft component, and whether it can be due to a hot interstellar medium\u000a(ISM), or is most likely originated by the collective emission of very soft\u000astellar sources. To this purpose, hydrodynamical evolutionary sequences for the\u000asecular behavior of gas flows in ellipticals have been performed, and the\u000aresults are compared with the observational X-ray data: the very soft component\u000acould be entirely explained with a hot ISM only in galaxies where the depth of\u000athe potential well is quite shallow, otherwise the softest contribution to the\u000aX-ray emission comes certainly from stellar sources. As stellar soft X-ray\u000aemitters, we consider late-type stellar corone, supersoft sources such as those\u000adiscovered by ROSAT in the Magellanic Clouds and M31, and RSCVn systems. We\u000afinally present a model for the X-ray emission of NGC4365, to reproduce in\u000adetail the results of the ROSAT pointed observation (PSPC spectrum and radial\u000asurface brightness distribution).\u000a

V  We show that a bounded, isolated quantum system of many particles in a\u000aspecific initial state will approach thermal equilibrium if the energy\u000aeigenfunctions which are superposed to form that state obey {\u005cit Berry's\u000aconjecture}. Berry's conjecture is expected to hold only if the corresponding\u000aclassical system is chaotic, and essentially states that the energy\u000aeigenfunctions behave as if they were gaussian random variables. We review the\u000aexisting evidence, and show that previously neglected effects substantially\u000astrengthen the case for Berry's conjecture. We study a rarefied hard-sphere gas\u000aas an explicit example of a many-body system which is known to be classically\u000achaotic, and show that an energy eigenstate which obeys Berry's conjecture\u000apredicts a Maxwell--Boltzmann, Bose--Einstein, or Fermi--Dirac distribution for\u000athe momentum of each constituent particle, depending on whether the wave\u000afunctions are taken to be nonsymmetric, completely symmetric, or completely\u000aantisymmetric functions of the positions of the particles. We call this\u000aphenomenon {\u005cit eigenstate thermalization}. We show that a generic initial\u000astate will approach thermal equilibrium at least as fast as\u000a$O(\u005chbar/\u005cDelta)t^{-1}$, where $\u005cDelta$ is the uncertainty in the total energy\u000aof the gas. This result holds for an individual initial state; in contrast to\u000athe classical theory, no averaging over an ensemble of initial states is\u000aneeded. We argue that these results constitute a new foundation for quantum\u000astatistical mechanics.\u000a

V  We adopt a new approach to explore the puzzling nature of faint blue field\u000agalaxies. Instead of assuming that the local luminosity function is well\u000adefined, we first determine whether any non-evolving set of luminosity\u000afunctions for different spectral types of galaxies is compatible with the\u000aobserved marginal distributions in optical and near-infrared counts, B - R\u000acolors, and redshifts. Exploiting a non-negative least squares method, we\u000aderive a new no-evolution model that is found to fit all the observations\u000asurprisingly well. We conclude that models more exotic than mild luminosity\u000aevolution, such as those requiring rapid evolution in star formation rates,\u000adisappearing dwarf galaxy populations, high values of the cosmological\u000aconstant, rapid mergers, or substantial non-conservation of galaxy numbers with\u000atime, are no longer as compelling.\u000a

V  We consider viscous rotating accretion flows in which most of the viscously\u000adissipated energy is stored as entropy rather than being radiated. Such\u000aadvection-dominated flows may occur when the optical depth is either very small\u000aor very large. We obtain a family of self-similar solutions where the\u000atemperature of the accreting gas is nearly virial and the flow is\u000aquasi-spherical. The gas rotates at much less than the Keplerian angular\u000avelocity; therefore, the central stars in such flows will cease to spin up long\u000abefore they reach the break-up limit. Further, the Bernoulli parameter is\u000apositive, implying that advection-dominated flows are susceptible to producing\u000aoutflows. Convection is likely in many of these flows and, if present, will\u000atend to enhance the above effects. We suggest that advection-dominated\u000aaccretion may provide an explanation for the slow spin rates of accreting stars\u000aand the widespread occurrence of outflows and jets in accreting systems.\u000a

V  Davidsen et al. (1991) have argued that the failure to detect uv photons from\u000athe dark matter DM) in cluster A665 excludes the decaying neutrino hypothesis.\u000aSciama et al. (1993) argued that because of high central concentration the DM\u000ain that cluster must be baryonic. We study the DM profile in clusters of\u000agalaxies simulated using the Harrison--Zel'dovich spectrum of density\u000afluctuations, and an amplitude previously derived from numerical simulations\u000a(Melott 1984b; Anninos et al. 1991) and in agreement with microwave background\u000afluctuations (Smoot et al. 1992). We find that with this amplitude\u000anormalization cluster neutrino DM densities are comparable to observed cluster\u000aDM values. We conclude that given this normalization, the cluster DM should be\u000aat least largely composed of neutrinos. The constraint of Davidsen et al. can\u000abe somewhat weakened by the presence of baryonic DM; but it cannot be\u000aeliminated given our assumptions.\u000a

V  We apply the new distance measuring technique of Hendry, O'Dell and Collier-\u000aCameron, 1993, to the Pleiades and $\u005calpha$ Persei clusters. The method relies\u000aon knowledge of the periods, rotation velocities and angular diameters of a\u000asample of late-type stars within each cluster. The angular diameters were found\u000aby recalibrating the Barnes-Evans surface brightness relation. Applying our new\u000adistance method we derive a Pleiades distance in very good agreement with\u000aprevious ZAMS fitting determinations, whereas our $\u005calpha$ Persei distance\u000aappears substantially greater. In response to this greater distance, we apply a\u000arecent semi-empirical main-seqeunce fitting technique to $\u005calpha$ Persei and\u000aconfirm the findings of our new distance indicator.

V  We quantitatively compare a particle implementation of the adhesion\u000aapproximation to fully non--linear, numerical nbody simulations. Our primary\u000atool, cross--correlation of nbody simulations with the adhesion approximation,\u000aindicates good agreement, better than that found by the same test performed\u000awith the Zel'dovich approximation (hereafter ZA). However, the\u000across--correlation is not as good as that of the truncated Zel'dovich\u000aapproximation (TZA), obtained by applying the Zel'dovich approximation after\u000asmoothing the initial density field with a Gaussian filter. We confirm that the\u000aadhesion approximation produces an excessively filamentary distribution.\u000aRelative to the nbody results, we also find that: (a) the power spectrum\u000aobtained from the adhesion approximation is more accurate than that from ZA or\u000aTZA, (b) the error in the phase angle of Fourier components is worse than that\u000afrom TZA, and (c) the mass distribution function is more accurate than that\u000afrom ZA or TZA. It appears that adhesion performs well statistically, but that\u000aTZA is more accurate dynamically, in the sense of moving mass to the right\u000aplace.\u000a  Subject Heading: Galaxies, formation, clustering--large--scale structure of\u000athe Universe\u000a

V  In principle, the tensor metric (gravity-wave) perturbations that arise in\u000ainflationary models can, beyond probing the underlying inflationary model,\u000aprovide information about the Universe: ionization history, presence of a\u000acosmological constant, and epoch of matter-radiation equality. Because tensor\u000aperturbations give rise to anisotropy of the cosmic background radiation (CBR)\u000asolely through the Sachs-Wolfe effect we are able to calculate analytically the\u000avariance of the multipole moments of this part of the CBR temperature\u000aanisotropy. In so doing, we carefully take account of the contribution of\u000atensor perturbations that entered the Hubble radius during both the\u000amatter-dominated and radiation-dominated epoch by means of a transfer function.\u000aThe striking feature in the spectrum of multipole amplitudes is a dramatic fall\u000aoff for $l\u005cga \u005csqrt{1+\u005czl}$, where $\u005czl$ is the red shift of the\u000alast-scattering surface. ...\u000a

V  By carefully studying the (1,0)+(0,1) representation space for massive\u000aparticles we point to the existence of certain inherent tachyonic dispersion\u000arelations: E^2= p^2-m^2. We put forward an interpretation that exploits these\u000a``negative mass squared'' solutions; rotational invariance is spontaneously\u000abroken. Relevance of these results to the vortices in the cosmos is pointed\u000aout.\u000a  NOTE: Just as "negative energy solutions'' of Dirac equation are\u000are-interpreted as antiparticles, similarly the possibility exists for\u000are-interpreting the tachyonic dispersion relations of all (j,0)+(0,j)\u000arepresentation spaces via spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking. In Mod. Phys.\u000aLett. A8:2623-2630,1993 we exhibited this explicitly for the j=1 representation\u000aspace. The interest in this old subject has grown markedly in recent years as\u000ais evident from numerous theoretical and phenomenological works on the subject.\u000aWith this observation, we make this replacement of our paper fourteen years\u000aafter its initial publication. The Abstract and main text remain unaltered. The\u000atitle is changed to reflect the underlying physics more closely.\u000a

V  Collisionless particles, such as cold dark matter, interact only by gravity\u000aand do not have any associated length scale, therefore the dark halos of\u000agalaxies should have negligible core radii. This expectation has been supported\u000aby numerical experiments of collisionless particles within scale free and cold\u000adark matter cosmologies. Most dwarf spiral galaxies are almost completely dark\u000amatter dominated, allowing a unique insight into their mass - density profiles\u000awhich can be approximated by isothermal spheres with core radii of order 3 - 7\u000akpc. We can therefore make a direct comparison between these galaxies, and\u000ahalos which form within the numerical simulations. This yields a severe\u000adiscrepancy in that the simulations predict the density to fall as rho(r)\u000a\u005cpropto r^{-1} on the scales where the data show that rho(r) = const: e.g. the\u000amodels overestimate the mass within the central few kpc of the halos by a\u000afactor of four. The formation of the luminous component of galaxies exacerbates\u000athis disparity between theory and observations, since the contraction of the\u000abaryons can significantly increase the central dark matter density.\u000a

The\u000aprofile shape and centroid redshift also distinguish this HeII component from\u000athe BLR features. The large ratio of HeII\u005cl 4686 to any analogous H$\u005cbeta$\u000aemission component is an indicator that it arises in a very high density region\u000a($n_e \u005csimgt 10^{11}-10^{13}$ \u005ccm3).

Upper bounds on\u000a$\u005cdelta\u005crho/\u005crho$ require $\u005clambda < 10^{-13}$. Ratra has shown that an\u000aalternative treatment of reheating results in $\u005cdelta\u005crho/\u005crho \u005cpropto\u000a\u005clambda^{-1}$, so that an upper bound on $\u005cdelta\u005crho/\u005crho$ does not put an\u000aobvious upper bound on $\u005clambda$. We verify that $\u005cdelta\u005crho/\u005crho \u005cpropto\u000a\u005clambda^{-1}$ is indeed a possibility, but show that $\u005clambda < 10^{-13}$ is\u000astill required.\u000a

V  Gamma ray burst sources are isotropically distributed. They could be located\u000aat distances $\u005csim 1000$ AU. (Katz \u005ccite{JK92}) GRB signals have many narrow\u000apeaks that are unresolved at the millisecond time resolution of existing\u000aobservations. \u005ccite{JK87} CETI could use stars as gravitational lenses for\u000ainterstellar gamma ray laser beam communication. Much better time resolution of\u000aGRB signals could rule out (or confirm?) the speculative hypothesis that GRB =\u000aCETI.\u000a

Furthermore, the perturbations of Liouville's equation for\u000acollisionless particles and Boltzmann's equation for Compton scattering are\u000aworked out. We fully discuss the propagation of photons in a perturbed\u000aFriedmann universe, calculating the Sachs--Wolfe effect and light deflection.\u000aThe perturbation equations are extended to accommodate also perturbations\u000ainduced by seeds.\u000a  With these general results we discuss some of the main aspects of the texture\u000amodel for the formation of large scale structure in the\u000a  Universe (galaxies, clusters, sheets, voids).\u000a  In this model, perturbations in the dark matter are induced by texture seeds.\u000a  The gravitational effects of a spherically symmetric collapsing texture on\u000adark matter, baryonic matter and photons are calculated in first order\u000aperturbation theory. We study the characteristic signature of the microwave\u000abackground fluctuations induced in this scenario and compare it with the COBE\u000aobservations.\u000a

V  The formation of galaxies in a CDM cosmogony is investigated by following the\u000aevolution of dark and baryonic matter and of the frequency- dependent spatially\u000aaveraged radiation field. The gas is allowed to form stars which are\u000aindependently treated as a fourth collisionless component. By supernovae,\u000aenergy and metal enriched gas is returned to the interstellar medium. Two\u000aextreme cases, the formation of an isolated field galaxy and the merging of two\u000agas rich proto spirals are considered the latter being used as a model for\u000agalaxy formation in a cluster. The isolated galaxy is assumed to interact with\u000athe surrounding matter via tidal fields only, resulting in a rotation with a\u000aspin parameter of about 0.08. The forming field galaxy shows the main\u000aproperties of spiral galaxies: A metal rich, rotatianally flattened bulge, a\u000ametal poor anisotrope stellar halo and a exponetial disk of nearly solar\u000acomposition. The spiral is embedded in a triaxial halo of dark matter. The\u000astars of the bulge form from gas which is initially located in the largest\u000amaxima of the primordial density fluctuations, whereas the halo stars originate\u000afrom gas accumulated in less pronounced maxima. Merging proto spirals evolve to\u000aobjects which can be interpreted as luminous ellipticals . The metal rich\u000aanisotrope elliptical rotates only slowly. Depending on the geometry of the\u000amerger event sometimes counter rotating gas is observed.\u000a

Within the limited range of spatial scales\u000acovered by the COBE DMR, corresponding to spherical harmonic indices $3 \u005cleq\u000a\u005cell \u005clsim 30$, the best fitting value of the spectral index is $n =\u000a1.25^{+0.4}_{-0.45}$ with the Harrison-Zeldovich value $n = 1$ approximately\u000a0.5$\u005csigma$ below the best fit. For $3 \u005cleq \u005cell \u005clsim 19$, the best fit is $n\u000a= 1.46^{+0.39}_{-0.44}$. Comparing the COBE DMR $\u005cDelta T/T$ at small $\u005cell$ to\u000athe $\u005cDelta T/T$ at $\u005cell \u005capprox 50$ from degree scale anisotropy experiments\u000agives a smaller range of acceptable spectral indices which includes $n = 1$.\u000a

V  We present new magnitudes derived from 1.65 micron images for 23 galaxies in\u000athe Ursa Major cluster. Magnitudes now exist for all but one spiral meeting our\u000acriteria for cluster membership and having HI velocity width greater than 187\u000akm/s and inclination greater than 45 deg. These spirals fit a Tully-Fisher\u000arelation with dispersion in intrinsic magnitudes (after known observational\u000auncertainties and the effect of cluster depth are removed) of 0.36 and a slope\u000aof 10.2 +/- 0.6. The magnitude dispersion is smaller than found in the Virgo\u000acluster but still significantly larger than claimed by some authors. We find a\u000ahint that the Tully-Fisher relation may turn over at the bright end. Adding the\u000acentral surface brightness of the disk as a third parameter flattens the slope\u000aof the Tully- Fisher relation and may give a distance estimate with slightly\u000aless dispersion, but the significance of the decrease must be tested on an\u000aindependent sample.\u000a

The parameters which admit this solution arise\u000anaturally from the process of neutrino induced inflation of baryon\u000ainhomogeneities prior to the epoch of nucleosynthesis. These solutions entail a\u000asmall fraction of baryons (\u005cle 2\u005c%) in very high density regions with local\u000abaryon-to-photon ratio $\u005ceta^h\u005capprox 10^{-4}$, while most baryons are at a\u000abaryon-to-photon ratio which optimizes the agreement with light-element\u000aabundances. The model would imply a unique signature of baryon inhomogeneities\u000ain the early universe, evidenced by the existence of primordial material\u000acontaining heavy-element products of proton and alpha- burning reactions with\u000aan abundance of $[Z]\u005csim -6 to -4$.\u000a

To do these calculations, we have chosen forbidden line\u000aelectron densities, observed angular diameters, and H${\u005cbeta}$ fluxes, from the\u000amost recent measurements available in the literature. Statistical analysis on\u000athe distributions of ${\u005cvarepsilon}$ and ${\u005crm M_i}$ show that (1) the ranges\u000aof values of these parameters is wider than what was previously found; (2) the\u000amean value of the filling factor is between $0.3$ and $0.4$, for the different\u000asets; (3) the mean value of the ionized mass is between $0.1$ and $0.25$\u000a$M_{\u005codot}$; (4) a clear correlation between the filling factors and the\u000adimensions of the PNe was not found when distance-independent sets of PNe were\u000aused; (5) for extragalactic PNe, where distance errors are not a factor, the\u000afilling factors and the ionized masses anticorrelate tightly with the electron\u000adensities. The results indicate that the modified Shklowsky distance method is\u000acorrect.\u000a

V  We present a detailed study of the growth of the Parker instability in a\u000adifferentially rotating disk embedded in an azimuthal equilibrium magnetic\u000afield, such as the interstellar gas or an accretion disk. Basic properties of\u000athe instability without shear are first recalled. Differential rotation is\u000amodeled in the shearing sheet approximation, classical in the theory of spiral\u000adensity waves. The action of differential rotation is reduced to two different\u000aeffects, (i) a linear time-dependence of the radial wavenumber, and (ii) a\u000aradial differential force. We present both exact numerical solutions, and\u000aapproximate analytical ones based on the WKB approximation in the limit of weak\u000adifferential rotation. Most important are (i) a transient natural stabilization\u000aof the Parker mode due to the radial differential force (ii) the generation of\u000amagnetosonic and Alfvenic waves, and (iii) in a certain parameter range a\u000apossible ``turn-over'' of the perturbation whereby, quite surprisingly, matter\u000awhich had started being elevated by the instability may end up dropping towards\u000athe disk midplane. A simplified model shows the possible observable effects of\u000athis turn-over.\u000a

V  We investigate the global structure of inflationary universe both by\u000aanalytical methods and by computer simulations of stochastic processes in the\u000aearly Universe. We show that the global structure of the universe depends\u000acrucially on the mechanism of inflation. In the simplest models of chaotic\u000ainflation the Universe looks like a sea of thermalized phase surrounding\u000apermanently self-reproducing inflationary domains. In the theories where\u000ainflation occurs near a local extremum of the effective potential corresponding\u000ato a metastable state, the Universe looks like de Sitter space surrounding\u000aislands of thermalized phase. A similar picture appears even if the state $\u005cphi\u000a= 0$ is unstable but the effective potential has a discrete symmetry $\u005cphi \u005cto\u000a=-\u005cphi$. In this case the Universe becomes divided into domains containing\u000adifferent phases. These domains will be separated from each other by domain\u000awalls. However, unlike ordinary domain walls, these domain walls will inflate,\u000aand their thickness will exponentially grow. In the theories with continuous\u000asymmetries inflation generates exponentially expanding strings and monopoles\u000asurrounded by thermalized phase. Inflating topological defects will be stable,\u000aand they will unceasingly produce new inflating topological defects. This means\u000athat topological defects may play a role of indestructible seeds for eternal\u000ainflation.\u000a

V  The $(3+1)$-dimensional evolution of an inhomogeneous axion field\u000aconfiguration around the QCD epoch is studied numerically, including important\u000anon-linear effects due to the attractive self-interaction. It is found that\u000aaxion perturbations on scales corresponding to causally disconnected regions at\u000a$T \u005csim 1 \u005c, {\u005crm GeV}$ can lead to very dense pseudo-soliton configurations we\u000acall axitons.

This is high enough for the\u000acollisional $2a \u005crightarrow 2a$ process to lead to Bose--Einstein relaxation in\u000athe gravitationally bound clumps of axions, forming Bose stars.\u000a

V  Using an analytical model for the string network we show that the kurtosis of\u000acosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature gradient maps is a good statistic\u000ato distinguish between the cosmic string model and inflationary models of\u000astructure formation. The difference between the stringy and inflationary value\u000afor the kurtosis is inversely proportional to the angular resolution and to the\u000anumber of strings per Hubble volume of the strings' scaling solution. If\u000astrings are indeed responsible for CMB anisotropies then experiments with\u000aresolutions of a couple of arcminutes or smaller could determine it using this\u000astatistic.\u000a

V  We have used HRCam on the CFHT to obtain subarcsecond images of 26 galaxies\u000awith z=0.1--0.7. The primary sample of 17 galaxies have enhanced star formation\u000aindicated by [OII] equivalent widths greater than 20\u005cAA, while the comparison\u000asample of 9 galaxies have equivalent widths less than 10\u005cAA. By fitting disks\u000aor bulges to BVI images we derive scalelengths for the blue and red stellar\u000apopulations and locate the star-formation in each galaxy. These\u000amoderate-redshift galaxies generally have straightforward low-redshift\u000aanalogues, in that their colours, sizes and luminosities are consistent with\u000athose of various types of z$\u005capprox$0 galaxies. The star-forming objects have\u000astructures consistent with the full range of present-day disk galaxies, and\u000aabsolute magnitudes M$^\u005cast$$-$1 to M$^\u005cast$+5. Some have star-formation\u000aconcentrated in their nuclei but in most it occurs across the entire disk. We\u000afind companions at projected distances closer than 10 kpc for 30% of the\u000astar-forming galaxies, whereas none of the comparison sample have such close\u000acompanions. This provides the first direct evidence linking interactions or\u000amergers to the increased fraction of star-forming field galaxies at moderate\u000aredshifts.\u000a

It is seen to be very efficient, even in\u000athe non-linear regime, and may thus be used as an analytical tool to study the\u000aeffect on the PDF of the transition between the weakly non-linear regime and\u000athe highly non-linear regime.\u000a

V  The suggestion has been made that the energy spectrum from point sources such\u000aas AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei) and GBHC (Galactic Black Hole Candidates) is\u000auniversal, irrespective of the nature of the emitted particles. A comparison of\u000athe energy spectrum for cosmic rays at the source and $\u005cgamma$-rays from\u000aquasars obtained recently by CGRO (Compton Gamma Ray Observatory) indicates\u000athat the prediction is in agreement with the data in the average sense. This\u000asuggests that neutrinos from point sources should have a spectral index\u000aidentical to that of $\u005cgamma$-rays for an individual point source. This\u000aprediction is also consistent with the recent observation of neutrinos by\u000aKamiokande and IMB in which the ratio of $\u005cnu_\u005cmu/\u005cnu_e$ is close to 1, instead\u000aof 2 as expected from atmospheric neutrinos. For a further test of the model,\u000aanalysis of the time variation of $\u005cgamma$-ray spectra from quasars is\u000asuggested.\u000a

When some of the degrees of freedom are of the\u000asame type a tensor virial theorem presents itself. Further generalizations are\u000adiscussed.\u000a  Symmetries of the action may lead to identities involving the VR.\u000a  Beside pointing to a unified provenance of the VR, and affording general\u000asystematics of them, our method is a simple prescription for deriving such\u000arelations. It is particularly useful for treating high-derivative and non-local\u000atheories. We demonstarte the procedure with several examples.\u000a

V  Saxino decay can generate significant cosmological entropy, and hence dilute\u000atheoretical estimates of the present mass density of a given particle species.\u000aThe dilution factor depends on the saxino and axion masses, and is constrained\u000aby the requirement that saxino decay should not affect nucleosynthesis, as well\u000aas by the usual requirement that the axion density be less than the critical\u000adensity. The latter constraint is evaluated carefully, under both the\u000aHarari-Sikivie and Davis proposals about the emission spectrum from axionic\u000astrings. Uncertainties are carefully evaluated, points of principle are\u000aaddressed, and with an eye to future numerical simulation the spacing and\u000atypical oscillation wavelength of the strings are represented by parameters\u000avarying in the range 1 to 3. Within the constraints, the entropy dilution\u000avaries from 1 to $10^{-4}$. Only saxinos originating from thermal equilibrium\u000aare considered, so that more dilution might arise from non-thermal saxinos.\u000a

V  A model of a stationary universe is proposed. In this framework, time is\u000adefined as a local and quantum-mechanical notion in the sense that it is\u000adefined for each local and quantum-mechanical system consisting of finite\u000anumber of particles. The total universe consisting of infinite number of\u000aparticles has no time associated. It is a stationary bound state of the total\u000aHamiltonian of infinite degrees of freedom. The quantum mechanics and the\u000atheory of general relativity are consistently united in this context if one\u000auses this notion of local and quantum-mechanical time. As one of the\u000aconsequences, the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox is resolved. The Hubble\u000ared-shift is explained as a consequence of general relativity which is\u000aconsistent with quantum mechanics. This does not require us to argue on the\u000abeginning nor the end of the universe. The universe just exists without time.\u000a(published in Il Nuovo Cimento, Vol. 109 B, N. 3, 1994, pp. 281-302)\u000a

V  Progress on the physics of strings in curved spacetime are comprehensively\u000areviewed.We start by showing through renormalization group arguments that a\u000ameaningful quantum theory of gravity must be finite and must include all\u000aparticle physics.Then, we review classical and quantum string propagation in\u000acurved spacetimes.We start by the general expansion method proposed by de Vega\u000aand S\u005c'anchez in 1987. The particle transmutation phenomena in asymptotically\u000aflat spacetimes are detailed including fermion-boson transitions in\u000asupergravity backgrounds.The next chapters review the exactly solvable cases of\u000astring propagation: shock waves, singular plane waves, conical spacetimes and\u000ade Sitter cosmological spacetime. The calculation of various physical\u000aquantities like the string mass and the energy-momentum tensor shows that\u000aclassical and quantum string propagation in shock-waves and singular plane\u000awaves is physically meaningful and full of interesting new phenomena.The\u000aimportant phenomenom of {\u005cbf string stretching} that takes place when strings\u000afall into spacetime singularities and in expanding universes is analyzed.We\u000aconclude by reporting on strings in de Sitter spacetime, where the string\u000aequations are integrable and reduce to the sinh-Gordon equation and to\u000aintegrable generalizations of it.

V  In the non-critical string framework that we have proposed recently, the time\u000a$t$ is identified with a dynamical local renormalization group scale, the\u000aLiouville mode, and behaves as a statistical evolution parameter, flowing\u000airreversibly from an infrared fixed point - which we conjecture to be a\u000atopological string phase - to an ultraviolet one - which corresponds to a\u000astatic critical string vacuum. When applied to a toy two-dimensional model of\u000aspace-time singularities, this formalism yields an apparent renormalization of\u000athe velocity of light, and a $t$-dependent form of the uncertainty relation for\u000aposition and momentum of a test string. We speculate within this framework on a\u000astringy alternative to conventional field-theoretical inflation, and the decay\u000atowards zero of the cosmological constant in a maximally-symmetric space.\u000a

V  This paper describes the numerical evolution of an $N$-body system with a\u000aslight ``temperature inversion''; i.e. the maximum velocity dispersion occurs\u000anot at the centre but further out. Fluid models predict that the core of such a\u000asystem expands on a time-scale of thousands of central relaxation times, and\u000ahere this behaviour is qualitatively confirmed for an $N$-body system of over\u000a3000 bodies. With certain qualifications, this demonstrates the existence in\u000aN-body systems of one of the fundamental mechanisms which, in fluid models,\u000adrive the gravothermal oscillations discovered by Bettwieser & Sugimoto.\u000a

V  We analyze the statistical properties of bubble models for the large-scale\u000adistribution of galaxies. To this aim, we realize static simulations, in which\u000agalaxies are mostly randomly arranged in the regions surrounding bubbles. As a\u000afirst test, we realize simulations of the Lick map, by suitably projecting the\u000athree-dimensional simulations. In this way, we are able to safely compare the\u000aangular correlation function implied by a bubbly geometry to that of the APM\u000asample. We find that several bubble models provide an adequate amount of\u000alarge-scale correlation, which nicely fits that of APM galaxies. Further, we\u000aapply the statistics of the count-in-cell moments to the three-dimensional\u000adistribution and compare them with available observational data on variance,\u000askewness and kurtosis. Based on our purely geometrical constructions, we find\u000athat a well defined hierarchical scaling of higher order moments up to scales\u000a$\u005csim 70\u005chm$. The overall emerging picture is that the bubbly geometry is well\u000asuited to reproduce several aspects of large-scale clustering.\u000a

V  We present a new analysis of previously published optical and radio data sets\u000aof the gravitationally lensed quasar 0957+561 A,B with the aim of determining\u000athe time delay between its two images. We use a non-parametric estimate of the\u000adispersion of the combined data set where, however, we only make use of\u000aalternating neighbours in order to avoid windowing effects.\u000a  From the optical data a time delay of (415 $\u005cpm$ 32) days and from the radio\u000adata a delay of (409 $\u005cpm$ 23) days is suggested. We demonstrate a considerable\u000asensitivity of different delay estimation procedures against the removal of\u000aonly a few observational data points or against smoothing or detrending of the\u000aoriginal data sets. The radio data give us formally a slightly more precise\u000avalue for the time delay than the optical data. Also, due to the lack of\u000awindowing effects, the result obtained for the radio data can be considered as\u000asomewhat more reliable than the delay determined from the optical data.\u000a

V  It is suggested that gravity waves could, in several cases, be detected by\u000ameans of already (or shortly to be) available technology, independently of\u000acurrent efforts of detection. The present is a follow-up on a recently\u000asuggested detection strategy based on gravity-wave-induced deviations of null\u000ageodesics. The new development is that a way was found to probe the waves close\u000ato the source, where they are several orders of magnitude larger than on the\u000aEarth. The effect translates into apparent shifts in stellar angular positions\u000athat could be as high as $10^{-7}$ arcsec, which is just about the present\u000atheoretical limit of detectability.

V  Formation theories for central dominant galaxies in clusters require them to\u000abe located at the minimum of the cluster gravitational potential. However, 32\u005c%\u000a(8 out of 25) of the clusters with more than 50 measured redshifts have central\u000agalaxies with significant velocity offsets (with respect to other cluster\u000amembers). By studying their velocity distributions and correlations between\u000avelocity and position, I show that the presence of a large peculiar velocity is\u000astrongly correlated with the presence of substructure in these massive systems.\u000aAbout 85\u005c% (21 of 25) of all well-studied clusters show some evidence for\u000asubstructure, in contrast to the 30-40\u005c% found when using only galaxy or gas\u000adistributions. The correlation between substructure and central galaxy location\u000averifies the hypothesis of Merritt (1985) and Tremaine (1990) that high\u000apeculiar velocities are indicative of recent merger events between less-massive\u000asystems of galaxies. Dynamical friction should act quickly to pull the central\u000agalaxy, the most massive discrete object in a cluster, to the minimum of the\u000apotential. The less-massive galaxies retain information about their primordial\u000asubclusters for a longer period of time. I use an objective partitioning\u000aalgorithm to assign cluster galaxies to their host subclumps. When galaxies are\u000aallocated in this fashion to their subclusters, 75\u005c% of the significant\u000avelocity offsets are eliminated. Only 2 out of the 25 clusters have central\u000agalaxies which are not centrally-located when substructure is considered in the\u000aanalysis.\u000a

V  As part of a stellar population sampling program, a series of photometric\u000aprobes at various field sizes and depths have been obtained in a low extinction\u000awindow in the galactic anticentre direction. Such data set strong constraints\u000aon the radial structure of the disc. At the forefront of this "drilling"\u000aprogram, very deep CCD frames probe the most external parts of the disc. Over\u000athe whole effective magnitude range (18 to 25), all contributions in the\u000astatistics which should be expected from old disc stars beyond 6 kpc vanish,\u000aalthough such stars dominate by far at distances less than 5 kpc. This is the\u000asignature of a sharp cut-off in the star density: the edge of the galactic disc\u000abetween 5.5 and 6 kpc. As a consequence, the galactic radius does not exceed 14\u000akpc (assuming $R/-/(//sun/)$=8.5). Colours of elliptical galaxies measured in\u000athe field rule out the risk of being misled by undetected extinction.\u000a

V  We review how the various large-scale data constrain cosmological parameters\u000aand, consequently, theories for the origin of large-scale structure in the\u000aUniverse. We discuss the form of the power spectrum implied by the correlation\u000adata of galaxies and argue by comparing the velocity field implied by the\u000adistribution of light with the observed velocity flows that the bias parameter,\u000a$b$, is likely to be constant in the linear regime. This then allows one to\u000aestimate the density parameter, $\u005cOmega$, and $b$ directly from the\u000a\u005cunderline{data} on $\u005cxi(r)$ and the velocity fields. We show that it is\u000aconsistent with low values of $\u005cOmega^{0.6}/b$. We discuss the ways to\u000anormalise the optical data at $z\u005csim0$ directly to the COBE (or other microwave\u000abackground) data. The data on high-$z$ \u005cunderline{galaxies} allows one to\u000afurther constrain the shape of the \u005cunderline{primordial} power spectrum at\u000ascales which are non-linear today ($< 8h^{-1}$Mpc) and we discuss the\u000aconsistency of the data with inflationary models normalised to the large-scale\u000astructure observations.\u000a

V  A method for calculating the retarded Green's function for the gravitational\u000awave equation in Friedmann-Roberson-Walker spacetimes, within the formalism of\u000alinearized Einstein gravity is developed. Hadamard's general solution to\u000aCauchy's problem for second-order, linear partial differential equations is\u000aapplied to the FRW gravitational wave equation.

The\u000aretarded Green's function for gravitational waves propagating through a\u000acosmological fluid composed of both radiation and dust is calculated\u000aanalytically for the first time. It is also shown that for all FRW spacetimes\u000ain which the Ricci scalar curvatures does not vanish, $R \u005cneq 0$, the Green's\u000afunction violates Huygens' principle; the Green's function has support inside\u000athe light-cone due to the scatter of gravitational waves off the background\u000acurvature.\u000a

We show that for faint ($<$10 mJy) objects observed at high\u000aangular resolution, previous determinations are indeed too low. For the bright\u000aobjects we find no significant differences. The new values are the most\u000aaccurate flux determinations yet for planetary nebulae, reaching 1\u005c% for the\u000abrightest objects in the sample. Based on the new data, we confirm that there\u000ais a systematic difference between the extinction derived from the\u000aradio/H$\u005cbeta$ flux ratio and derived from the Balmer decrement, which led to\u000athe suggestion of deviations from the standard extinction law. However, final\u000aconfirmation of this has to await the availibility of more, accurate\u000ameasurements of the Balmer (and/or Paschen) lines.\u000a

We identify nine metal absorption systems, of which four were\u000apreviously known. A fifth previously suggested system at $z_{abs} \u005capprox\u000a3.409$ (Turnshek et al~ 1991) is ruled out by our data. Two of the eight\u000asystems for which the \u005clya~ line is in the observable range have a damped \u005clya~\u000aline. Six of the nine systems show evidence for complex sub--component\u000astructure. At our resolution and S/N we identify a total of 21 sub--components\u000ain the nine systems. Five of the nine systems (11 of the 21 components) fall\u000awithin the $\u005cpm 5000$ \u005ckms~ range of the emission redshift, and are hence\u000aclassified as \u005czae~ absorbers. For the two damped systems we find metal\u000aabundances of $\u005cleq 1$% and $\u005cleq 8$% of solar values at redshifts of 3.0541\u000aand 3.3901 respectively. These upper limits are consistent with what would be\u000aexpected from previous determinations at lower redshifts, and our data are\u000ahence compatible with earlier conclusions that no evidence is yet found for\u000achemical evolution of intervening damped and Lyman limit absorbers. For the\u000a\u005czae~ systems we found indications of metallicities comparable to, and even in\u000aexcess of solar values. These much higher values compared to the damped\u000asystems, are in favour of the intrinsic hypothesis for these systems.\u000a

V  We present the static, spherically symmetric solutions of the low energy $d =\u000a4$ string. They form a simple generalisation of the Schwarzschild solution and\u000adescribe the gravitational field of a spherical star in perturbative string\u000atheory. If the Robertson parameter $\u005cgamma$ is different from one, these\u000asolutions describe singular objects with naked singularities at their horizons,\u000aand whose Hawking temperature is infinite. These objects might represent\u000a``massive remnants'', the end states of black holes. Our analysis also implies\u000athat Brans-Dicke theory has a naked singularity. Invoking cosmic censorship\u000aconjecture will rule out Brans-Dicke theory.\u000a

V  We discuss in detail the effect of neutrino oscillations in Big Bang\u000anucleosynthesis, between active and sterile neutrinos, as well as between\u000aactive and active neutrinos. We calculate the constraints on mixings between\u000aactive and sterile neutrinos from the present observation of the primordial\u000ahelium abundance and discuss the potential implications on various\u000aastrophysical and cosmological problems of such oscillations. In particular, we\u000ashow that large angle sterile neutrino mixing seems to be excluded as a MSW\u000asolution to the solar neutrino situation or a solution to the atmospheric\u000aneutrino mixing hinted at in some underground experiments. We show how with\u000athis constraint, the next generation of solar neutrino experiments should be\u000aable to determine the resolution of the solar neutrino problem. It is also\u000ashown how sterile neutrinos remain a viable dark matter candidate.\u000a

V  We discuss some outstanding open questions regarding the validity and\u000auniqueness of the standard second order Newton-Einstein classical gravitational\u000atheory. On the observational side we discuss the degree to which the realm of\u000avalidity of Newton's Law of Gravity can actually be extended to distances much\u000alarger than the solar system distance scales on which the law was originally\u000aestablished. On the theoretical side we identify some commonly accepted but\u000aactually still open to question assumptions which go into the formulating of\u000athe standard second order Einstein theory in the first place. In particular, we\u000ashow that while the familiar second order Poisson gravitational equation (and\u000aaccordingly its second order covariant Einstein generalization) may be\u000asufficient to yield Newton's Law of Gravity they are not in fact necessary. The\u000astandard theory thus still awaits the identification of some principle which\u000awould then make it necessary too. We show that current observational\u000ainformation does not exclusively mandate the standard theory, and that the\u000aconformal invariant fourth order theory of gravity considered recently by\u000aMannheim and Kazanas is also able to meet the constraints of data, and in fact\u000ato do so without the need for any so far unobserved non-luminous or dark\u000amatter.\u000a

CDM with the initial spectrum of adiabatic perturbations produced in\u000athese models is compared with observations.

We normalize our spectra to COBE DMR and compare the predictions with\u000aobservations on the biasing factor, large-scale peculiar velocities, quasar and\u000agalaxy formation and the Stromlo-APM counts-in-cells analysis. The model with\u000a$n=4$ is excluded by the data while for the $n=2$ model, taking cosmic variance\u000ainto account, a small window of parameters compatible with observations is\u000afound.\u000a

V  A precise test of the theory of stellar evolution can be performed by\u000ameasuring the average difference in energy between the neutrino line produced\u000aby ${\u005crm ^7Be}$ electron capture in the solar interior and the corresponding\u000aneutrino line produced in a terrestrial laboratory. This energy shift is\u000acalculated to be 1.29~keV (to an accuracy of a few percent) for the dominant\u000aground-state to ground-state transition. The energy shift is approximately\u000aequal to the average temperature of the solar core, computed by integrating the\u000atemperature over the solar interior with a weighting factor equal to the\u000alocally-produced $^7$Be neutrino emission. The characteristic modulation of the\u000a${\u005crm ^7Be}$ line shape that would be caused by either vacuum neutrino\u000aoscillations or by matter-enhanced (MSW) neutrino oscillations is shown to be\u000asmall. Other frequently-discussed weak interaction solutions to the solar\u000aneutrino problem are also not expected to change significantly the line\u000aprofile. Therefore, a measurement of the energy shift is a measurement of the\u000acentral temperature distribution of the sun.\u000a

Neutralinos that are\u000apredominantly $B$-ino are the likeliest candidates for detection via\u000aspin-dependent interactions. Uncertainties in the measured spin content of the\u000anucleon may lead to dramatic uncertainties in the rates for detection of\u000a$B$-inos by scattering off of nuclei with unpaired neutrons. Rates for\u000aspin-dependent scattering of $B$-inos off of nuclei with unpaired protons are\u000afar more robust, as are rates for capture of $B$-inos in the Sun.\u000a

V  We present results of searching for the possible typical scales in the\u000aspatial distribution of QSOs. Our method is based on the second derivative of\u000athe two-point correlation function. This statistic is sensitive to the scale of\u000athe maximum in the spectrum $P(k)$ of the density perturbation in the universe.\u000aThis maximum or bend scale can be detected as the wavelengths of the periodic\u000acomponent in the second derivative of the integral correlation function. For\u000avarious QSO samples compiled from surveys of pencil-beam and bright QSOs, a\u000atypical scale of about 93 $\u005cpm$ 10 h$^{-1}$Mpc for $q_0=0.5$ has been detected.\u000aThis typical scale is in good agreement with that found in the spatial\u000adistributions of galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and CIV absorption systems of\u000aQSOs if $q_0$ is taken to be $\u005csim 0.2$. Therefore, it is likely a common or\u000auniversal scale in the large scale structure traced by these objects. This\u000aresult is consistent with the assumption that the typical scale comes from a\u000acharacteristic scale in the spectrum of the density perturbation in the\u000auniverse.\u000a

V  Recent work on the transport of angular momentum in accretion disks suggests\u000athat the Velikhov-Chandrasekhar instability, in which a large scale magnetic\u000afield generates small scale eddys in a shearing environment, may be ultimately\u000aresponsible for this process. Although there is considerable controversy about\u000athe origin and maintenance of this field in accretion disks, it turns out that\u000ait is possible to argue, quite generally, using scaling arguments, that this\u000aprocess is sensitive to the total pressure in an AGN disk, rather than the\u000apressure contributed by gas alone. We conclude that the resolution of the\u000aconceptual difficulties implied by the presence of strong thermal and viscous\u000ainstabilities in radiation pressure and electron scattering dominated does not\u000alie in models that couple the total dissipation rate to the gas pressure alone,\u000aor to some weighted mean of the gas and radiation pressures.\u000a

V  Information about the physical processes that generate the primordial\u000afluctuations in the early universe can be gained by testing the Gaussian nature\u000aof the fluctuations through cosmic microwave background radiation (CBR)\u000atemperature anisotropy experiments. One of the crucial aspects of density\u000aperturbations that are produced by the standard inflation scenario is that they\u000aare Gaussian, whereas seeds produced by topological defects left over from an\u000aearly cosmic phase transition tend to be non-Gaussian. To carry out this test,\u000asophisticated statistical tools are required. In this paper, we will discuss\u000aseveral such statistical tools, including multivariant skewness and kurtosis,\u000a  Euler-Poincare characteristics, the three point temperature correlation\u000afunction, and the Hotelling's $T^{2}$ statistic defined through bispectral\u000aestimates of a one dimensional dataset. The effect of noise present in the\u000acurrent data is discussed in detail and the COBE 53 GHz dataset is analyzed.\u000aOur analysis shows that, on the large angular scale to which COBE is sensitive,\u000athe statistics are probably Gaussian. On the small angular scales, the\u000aimportance of Hotelling's $T^{2}$ statistic is stressed, and the minimum sample\u000asize required to test Gaussianity is estimated. Although the current dataset\u000aavailable from various experiments at half-degree scales is still too small,\u000aimprovement of the dataset by roughly a factor of two will be enough to test\u000athe Gaussianity statistically. On the arcminute scales, we analyze the recent\u000aRING data through bispectral analysis, and the result\u000a

The\u000arelatively high resolution of the spectrum ($\u005csim 40$ km s$^{-1}$) allows the\u000aselection of regions free of strong absorption lines in the Lyman alpha forest.\u000aA reliable evaluation of the continuum shape is based on the careful flux\u000acalibration and on the large wavelength interval covered (5000--9300 ~\u005cAA). A\u000abest estimate of $\u005ctau _{_{GP}}\u005cleq 0.02\u005cpm 0.03$ has been found for the\u000aGunn-Peterson optical depth at the highest absorption redshift observed at this\u000aresolution, $z \u005csimeq 4.3$. The derived baryon density of the intergalactic\u000amedium is $\u005cOmega _{IGM}\u005cmincir 0.01$ if the observed quasars are the major\u000acontributor to the ionizing UV background flux. This limit, when compared with\u000athe total baryon density deduced from the nucleosynthesis, could imply that\u000amost of the baryons are already in bound systems at $z\u005csim 5$.\u000a

V  We present Lick Observatory slit spectra of 38 objects which were claimed to\u000ahave pronounced ultraviolet excess and emission lines by Zhan \u005c& Chen. Most of\u000aour spectra have FWHM spectral resolutions of about 4~\u005cAA , and relatively high\u000aS/N of about 10 -- 50, although some have FWHM $\u005csimeq 15$~\u005cAA ~or lower S/N.\u000aWe find eleven QSOs, four galaxies at $z \u005csimeq 0.1$, twenty-two stars and one\u000aunidentified object with a low S/N spectrum. Six of the QSOs show absorption\u000asystems, including Q0000+027A with a relatively strong associated C~IV\u000aabsorption system, and Q0008+008 (V$\u005csimeq 18.9$) with a damped Ly$\u005calpha $\u000asystem with an H~I column density of $10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. The stars include a\u000awide variety of spectral types. There is one new DA4 white dwarf at 170~pc, one\u000asdB at 14~kpc, and three M stars. The rest are of types F, G and K. We have\u000ameasured the equivalent widths of the Ca~II~K line, the G-band and the Balmer\u000alines in ten stars with the best spectra, and we derive metallicities. Seven of\u000athem are in the range $-2.5 \u005cleq$~[Fe/H]~$\u005cleq -1.7$, while the others are less\u000ametal poor. If the stars are dwarfs, then they are at distances of 1 to 7~kpc,\u000abut if they are giants, typical distances will be about 10~kpc.\u000a

V  This article reviews the prevailing paradigm for how galaxies and larger\u000astructures formed in the universe: gravitational instability. Basic\u000aobservational facts are summarized to motivate the standard cosmological\u000aframework underlying most detailed investigations of structure formation. The\u000aobserved universe approaches spatial uniformity on scales larger than about\u000a$10^{26}$ cm. On these scales gravitational dynamics is almost linear and\u000atherefore relatively easy to relate to observations of large-scale structure.\u000aOn smaller scales cosmic structure is complicated not only by nonlinear\u000agravitational clustering but also by nonlinear nongravitational gas dynamical\u000aprocesses. The complexity of these phenomena makes galaxy formation one of the\u000agrand challenge problems of the physical sciences. No fully satisfactory theory\u000acan presently account in detail for the observed cosmic structure. However, as\u000athis article summarizes, significant progress has been made during the last few\u000ayears.\u000a

V  We consider the evolution of the light elements ($Li, Be$ and $B$)\u000aincorporating the effects of their production by both neutrino process and\u000acosmic-ray nucleosynthesis. We test the viability of the neutrino process to\u000aresolve the long standing problem of the $^{11}$B/$^{10}$B isotopic ratio which\u000aamounts to 4 at the time of the formation of the solar system. This hypothesis\u000amay be ultimately constrained by the $B/Be$ ratio observed in halo stars.\u000aThough we are able to obtain a solar isotopic ratio $^{11}B/^{10}B \u005csimeq 4$,\u000athe current paucity of data at low metallicity prevents us from making a\u000adefinitive conclusion regarding the resolution of this problem. We show\u000ahowever, that neutrino process nucleosynthesis leads to a relatively model\u000aindependent prediction that the $B/Be$ elemental ratio is large ($>$ 50) at low\u000ametallicities ($[Fe/H] < -3.0$), if $Be$ is produced as a secondary element (as\u000ais the case in the conventional scenario of galactic cosmic-ray\u000anucleosynthesis).\u000a

V  We use new models of stellar population synthesis to estimate the fraction of\u000astars formed during the last major bursts of star formation in E/S0 galaxies in\u000alow-redshift clusters ($z\u005csimlt0.4$) from the spectral signatures of\u000aintermediate-age stars. We find that the mass fraction of stars formed in late\u000abursts in early-type galaxies in clusters must have decreased smoothly with\u000aredshift, from about 8\u005c% at $z\u005capprox1$ to less than 1\u005c% at $z\u005capprox0$. This\u000aresult, which we interpret as a constraint on stellar mass added in mergers, is\u000anearly independent of the assumed ages and morphological types of the\u000aprogenitor galaxies prior to the last major bursts of star formation. We then\u000acompute the implied color and 4000 {\u005cAA} break evolution for progenitors of\u000aE/S0 galaxies in clusters at redshifts $0\u005csimlt z\u005csimlt1$. We investigate a\u000aconservative model in which all present-day E/S0 galaxies are assumed to\u000ainitially be elliptical galaxies and to then undergo bursts of star formation\u000aat the rate estimated from the signatures of intermediate-age stars at low\u000aredshifts. This model reproduces well the observed spread of colors and 4000\u000a{\u005cAA} breaks of galaxies in high-redshift clusters, but underestimates the\u000afraction of galaxies in the blue tail of the distribution. Such a discrepancy\u000amay be interpreted as an increasing fraction of spiral galaxies in clusters at\u000ahigh redshift, as suggested independently by recent {\u005cit HST} observations of\u000aintermediate-redshift clusters. The current data do not seem to require\u000amorphological evolution of cluster galaxies out to $z\u005csim0.4$, but suggest that\u000aeither morphological or strong luminosity evolution might have played a major\u000arole at $z\u005csimgt0.7$.\u000a

V  We place empirical constraints on the physical properties of $\u005cgamma-$ray\u000aburst events at cosmological distances. In particular we derive probability\u000adistributions for the radiation energy $E_\u005cgamma$, the minimum Lorentz factor\u000a$\u005cgamma_{\u005crm min}$, the maximum baryonic mass $M_{\u005crm max}$ and the upper bound\u000aon the surrounding gas density $n_{\u005crm max}$ in the events, based on 169 bursts\u000afrom the first BATSE catalog. Using peak flux as a distance indicator we probe\u000abursts where the constraints are stronger than average. The resulting variance\u000aand skewness of the cosmological probability distributions are calculated in\u000aaddition to their mean values: $\u005clangle E_\u005cgamma\u005crangle=4\u005ctimes 10^{51} h^{-2}\u000a{\u005crm erg}$, $\u005clangle \u005cgamma_{\u005crm min}\u005crangle= 5\u005ctimes 10^2$, $\u005clangle M_{\u005crm\u000amax}\u005crangle=10^{-5}\u005cxi^{-1} M_\u005codot$, and $\u005clangle (\u005cgamma/\u005cgamma_{\u005crm\u000amin})^{-5} n_{\u005crm max}\u005crangle\u005clsim 10^{2} \u005cxi^{-1}{\u005crm cm^{-3}}$, where $\u005cxi$\u000ais the fraction of the total energy which is converted to $\u005cgamma-$rays. The\u000adistribution of burst energies ends at about $10^{53} {\u005crm erg}$, close to the\u000abinding energy of a neutron star.\u000a

V  The recent COBE measurement of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave\u000abackground and the recent South Pole experiment of Gaier {\u005cit et al.} offer an\u000aexcellent opportunity to probe cosmological theories. We test a class of\u000atheories in which the Universe today is flat and matter dominated, and\u000aprimordial perturbations are adiabatic parameterized by an index $n$. In this\u000aclass of theories the predicted signal in the South Pole experiment depends not\u000aonly on $n$, but also on the Hubble constant and the baryon density. For $n=1$\u000aa large region of this parameter space is ruled out, but there is still a\u000awindow open which satisfies constraints coming from COBE, measurements of the\u000aage of the Universe, the South Pole experiment, and big bang nucleosynthesis.\u000aUsing the central values of the Hubble constant and baryon density favored by\u000anucleosynthesis and age measurements, we find that, even if the COBE\u000anormalization drops by $1\u005csigma$, $n > 1.2$ is ruled out.\u000a

V  We suggest to use the common appearance of voids with a scale of $5000 \u005ckms$\u000ain the galaxy distribution to estimate the power spectrum on this scale. We use\u000aa simple model for a gravitational formation of voids and we compare the\u000aresults with the matter fluctuations as constrained by the CMBR observations of\u000aCOBE. We find that a power spectrum $P(k)\u005cpropto k^n$ with $n \u005capprox 1.25$ is\u000acompatible both with COBE and with gravitational growth of large voids in an\u000a$\u005cOmega=1$ universe. A Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum, $n=1$, normalized to\u000aproduce the observed CMBR fluctuations, does not have enough power for\u000agravitational growth of voids with a diameter of $5000 \u005ckms$ in an $\u005cOmega=1$\u000aUniverse. Such a spectrum would be compatible if (i) void diameters are smaller\u000a($3500 \u005ckms$), the voids are shallower or if the voids are rare (we assume that\u000athe universe is void filled); (ii) $\u005cOmega < 1$ i.e. the Universe is open;\u000a(iii) galaxies do not trace matter on very large scale or if (iv) the voids do\u000anot grow gravitationally.\u000a

V  It has been recently discovered that the angular autocorrelation function of\u000agamma-ray bursts exhibits sharp peaks at angular separations of $\u005clesssim\u000a4\u005cdeg$ (Quashnock and Lamb 1993), and at $\u005cgtrsim 176\u005cdeg$ (Narayan and Piran\u000a1993). While an excess of very close pairs of bursts can naturally arise from\u000aburst repetition or from a spatial correlation of the burst sources, a physical\u000aexplanation for an angular correlation on a scale of $\u005csimeq 180\u005cdeg$ seems\u000ainconceivable.\u000a  We show that both sharp peaks in the correlation function can be explained by\u000aa possible bias in the determination of the burst positions. A generic way is\u000adescribed in which the suggested bias can be introduced into the burst\u000alocalization procedure, either through instrumental imperfection or through the\u000asoftware analyses. We apply Monte Carlo simulations to show that the observed\u000acorrelation function can be reproduced by the suggested effect. We demonstrate\u000athat the results can nicely agree with the observations even if only a fraction\u000aof the bursts are subject to the bias.\u000a  We emphasis that the only motivation for suggesting the existence of this\u000abias are the features found in the angular autocorrelation function. It does\u000anot rule out the possibility that bursts repeat. The natural way in which such\u000abias, if it exists, explains both sharp peaks, and the various conceivable\u000acauses for the origin of this bias, make the bias hypothesis worth considering.\u000a

V  We present a thorough and detailed investigation of baryon isocurvature\u000amodels including realistic thermal histories, \u005cie, late or partial reionization\u000aof the universe and compact object formation after standard recombination.\u000aConstraints on these models are imposed from spectral distortion in the cosmic\u000amicrowave background (CMB), number fluctuations in galaxy counts $\u005csigma_8$,\u000aand recent CMB anisotropy observations. Since the status of degree scale\u000aanisotropies is as yet unclear, the lack of spectral distortions is the most\u000aserious constraint on the spectral index of initial fluctuations: $-1.2 \u005csimlt\u000an \u005csimlt -0.5$ in partially ionized models and $-1.2 \u005csimlt n \u005csimlt -0.9$ in\u000acompact object dominated universes in order to avoid significant bias in galaxy\u000aformation. Full ionization of the universe before $z = 300$ is also forbidden\u000aby this constraint. Intermediate scale CMB fluctuations which are significantly\u000alarger than standard CDM is a {\u005cit robust} prediction of these models. Many\u000amodels are consequently in conflict with the recent degree scale detections by\u000aPython, ARGO, and MSAM, \u005ceg, compact object dominated models with $\u005cOmega_0\u000a\u005csimlt 0.2$. Moreover, {\u005cit all} models will be ruled out if the low CMB\u000afluctuations on degree scales as detected by the SP91 13 point scan are\u000aconfirmed. On the other hand, most models fare well compared with the high\u000aTenerife and MAX detections.\u000a

We show that the generalized see-saw mechanism in this model can not\u000aonly provide MSW neutrino mixing suitable for solving the solar neutrino\u000aproblem, and supply a hot dark matter candidate ($\u005cnu_\u005ctau$) with mass\u000a$0(10)eV$ as indicated by recent COBE results, but can also naturally account\u000afor the baryon asymmetry of the universe. Heavy singlet neutrino decay\u000agenerates a net lepton asymmetry which is subsequently reprocessed by\u000anonperturbative electroweak interactions. We evaluate the baryon asymmetry so\u000aproduced in light of the constraints that the COBE observations put on\u000ainflationary cosmologies, finding it comfortably consistent with observation.\u000a

V  We apply the adhesion approximation to study the formation and evolution of\u000avoids in the Universe. Our simulations -- carried out using 128$^3$ particles\u000ain a cubical box with side 128 Mpc -- indicate that the void spectrum evolves\u000awith time and that the mean void size in the standard COBE-normalised Cold Dark\u000aMatter (hereafter CDM) model with $h_{50} = 1,$ scales approximately as $\u005cbar\u000aD(z) = {\u005cbar D_0\u005cover \u005csqrt {1+z}},$ where $\u005cbar D_0 \u005csimeq 10.5$ Mpc.\u000aInterestingly, we find a strong correlation between the sizes of voids and the\u000avalue of the primordial gravitational potential at void centers. This\u000aobservation could in principle, pave the way towards reconstructing the form of\u000athe primordial potential from a knowledge of the observed void spectrum.\u000aStudying the void spectrum at different cosmological epochs, for spectra with a\u000abuilt in $k$-space cutoff we find that, the number of voids in a representative\u000avolume evolves with time. The mean number of voids first increases until a\u000amaximum value is reached (indicating that the formation of cellular structure\u000ais complete), and then begins to decrease as clumps and filaments merge leading\u000ato hierarchical clustering and the subsequent elimination of small voids. The\u000acosmological epoch characterizing the completion of cellular structure occurs\u000awhen the length scale going nonlinear approaches the mean distance between\u000apeaks of the gravitational potential. A central result of this paper is that\u000a

V  As was shown before (Gurzadyan and Kocharyan, 1992, 1993ab) the statistical\u000aproperties (exponential mixing) of motion of CMB photon beams in Friedmann\u000aUniverse with negative curvature can have definite observable consequences\u000aincluding the decrease of the CMB anisotropy amplitude after the last\u000ascattering, distortion of images on CMB sky maps. Here we consider one more\u000aconsequence concerning the behaviour of temperature autocorrelation function\u000aC(\u005ctheta,\u005cbeta), where \u005ctheta is the modulation (separation) angle, and \u005cbeta\u000athe observing beam effective angle. We prove that in the Universe with negative\u000acurvature any spectrum of perturbations at last scattering epoch becomes a\u000ascale-invariant by present time. It is also predicted that the temperature\u000aautocorrelation function should increase while obtained from measurements with\u000asmall beam sizes within some mixing beam angle.\u000a

V  The dark matter in Galactic halos, or some fraction of it, may be in the form\u000aof dark clusters which consist of small mass objects. Carr & Lacey (1987) have\u000aderived the permissible properties of such systems, and proposed the existence\u000aof dark clusters with mass of order $10^6\u005csolarmass$ to explain some of the\u000aobserved dynamical properties of the stellar disk of the Galaxy. A population\u000aof bound systems with mass of $\u005csim 10^5-10^6\u005csolarmass$ is also an attractive\u000apossibility since it is close to the baryon Jeans mass at recombination, which\u000amay be the preferred mass scale for the first bound objects to form in the\u000auniverse. At the present, the existence of dark clusters which consist of brown\u000adwarfs, Jupiters, or black hole remnants of an early generation of stars, is\u000anot indicated, nor can be excluded on observational grounds.\u000a  We describe how dark clusters can be discovered in a sample of gravitational\u000amicrolensing events in LMC stars. Alternatively, it could provide strict bounds\u000aon the fraction of halo mass which resides in such systems. If MACHOs are\u000aclustered, the implied degeneracy in their spatial and velocity distributions\u000awould result in a strong autocorrelation in the sky position of microlensing\u000aevents on an angular scale $\u005clesssim 20$ arcsec, along with a correlation in\u000athe event duration.\u000a  We argue that a small number of events could be enough to indicate the\u000aexistence of clusters, and demonstrate that a sample of $\u005csimeq 10$ events\u000awould be sufficient to reject the proposal of Carr & Lacey (1987) at the $95\u005c%$\u000aconfidence level.\u000a

V  We derive the equations of motion for general strings, i.e. strings with\u000aarbitrary relation between tension $\u005ctau$ and energy per unit length\u000a$\u005cepsilon$. The renormalization of $\u005ctau$ and $\u005cepsilon$ that results from\u000aaveraging out small scale wiggles on the string is obtained in the general case\u000ato lowest order in the amount of wiggliness. For Nambu-Goto strings we find\u000adeviations from the equation of state $\u005cepsilon \u005ctau = {\u005crm constant}$ in\u000ahigher orders. Finally we argue that wiggliness may radically modify the gauge\u000acosmic string scenario.\u000a

V  We consider the Earth effect in the MSW analysis of the Homestake,\u000aKamiokande, GALLEX, and SAGE solar neutrino experiments. Using the\u000atime-averaged data and assuming two-flavor oscillations, the large-angle region\u000aof the combined fit extends to much smaller angles (to $\u005csin^22\u005ctheta \u005csimeq\u000a0.1$) than when the Earth effect is ignored. However, the additional constraint\u000afrom the Kamiokande II day-night data excludes most of the parameter space\u000asensitive to the Earth effect independent of astrophysical uncertainties, and\u000aleaves only a small large-angle region close to maximal mixing at 90\u005c% C.L.

V  Constraints on the core temperature (T_c) of the Sun and on neutrino-\u000aoscillation parameters are obtained from the existing solar neutrino data,\u000aincluding the recent GALLEX and Kamiokande III results. (1) A purely\u000aastrophysical solution to the solar neutrino problem is strongly disfavored by\u000athe data: the best fit in a cooler Sun model requires an 8% reduction in T_c,\u000abut the chi-sqaured test rejects this hypothesis at 99.99% C.L., suggesting new\u000aneutrino physics. (2) Assuming the Standard Solar Model (SSM) and MSW\u000aoscillations, the MSW parameters are constrained to two small regions: one in\u000athe non-adiabatic region and the other in the large-mixing region. The\u000anon-adiabatic solution gives a considerably better fit. For nu_e oscillations\u000ainto sterile neutrinos, the allowed region (90%) is constrained to non-\u000aadiabatic oscillations. As long as the SSM is assumed, the neutrino mixing\u000aangles are at least four times larger, or considerably smaller, than the\u000acorresponding quark mixing angles. (3) Allowing both MSW oscillations and a\u000anon-standard core temperature, a) the experiments determine the core\u000atemperature at the 5% level, yielding a value consistent with the SSM\u000aprediction. b) When T_c is used as a free parameter, the allowed MSW region is\u000abroadened: a cooler Sun (T_c=0.95) allows mass and mixing implied by the SUSY\u000aSO(10) GUT, while a warmer Sun (T_c=1.05) allows parameter space suggested by\u000aintermediate-scale SO(10) GUTs. Superstring-inspired models are consistent with\u000aall solutions. (4) From the narrowed parameter space, we predict the neutrino\u000aspectral shape which should be observed in SNO. Throughout the calculation we\u000ause the latest Bahcall-Pinsonneault SSM, and include nuclear and astrophysical\u000auncertainties in a simplified, but physically transparent way.\u000a

V  In paper I, we have studied the conditions under which flux tubes are\u000aexpelled from adiabatic thick accretion disks. In the present paper, we explore\u000aa few other models of thick disks, where flux tubes could be stored. We show\u000athat flux tubes with sufficiently weak fields are not expelled out if they move\u000aadiabatically inside an isothermal disk; they continue to oscillate around mean\u000aequipotential surfaces inside the disk. If the field in the flux tube is\u000aamplified due to the shear, they are eventually expelled away. We explore a\u000a`toy' model also, where the entropy increase outwards from the center of the\u000athick disk and find a similar behavior. Flux storage in the disk, as in the\u000acase of the sun, in general, enhances the possibility of sustained magnetic\u000aactivity formation of coronae in the chimney region. The existence of coronae\u000aon the disk surface may explain the short-time variability in the spectra of\u000aBlazars and the emission of energetic particles from AGNs and Quasars. It may\u000aalso supply matter to the cosmic jets through magnetized winds.\u000a

V  Paczy\u005c'nski (1986) suggested that ``dark" objects in the halo of our Galaxy\u000acould enhance the luminosity of foreground stars, acting as gravitational\u000amicrolenses. Such events has been recently reported by different\u000acollaborations. We assume that these microlensing events are produced by\u000abaryonic objects in the halo of our Galaxy. Rather than adopting a mean mass\u000afor the lensing objects we consider them distributed along a mass function\u000asimilar to the disk one. Even if the number of microlensing events so far\u000adetected is not large, we show that it is possible to constrain the fraction of\u000amass density in the halo of our Galaxy in form of stars. We estimate that this\u000afraction varies between 0.1 and 0.8, if halo stars trace the total halo mass\u000adensity; in the opposite case this range becomes narrower. If lensing objects\u000ahave not been formed apart from the other halo stars, but in a more general\u000acontext of star formation, neutron stars must also be present. We discuss these\u000aresults in relation to galactic halo models for gamma-ray bursts.\u000a

V  We have carried out a deep (t=30000s) x-ray search of the eastern portion of\u000athe L1495 cloud centered on the well known weak line T Tauri star (WTTS) V410\u000aTau using the ROSAT PSPC. This deep exposure enabled a search for candidate\u000apre-main sequence (PMS) objects in this cloud to a limit 20 times more\u000asensitive than that typical of the fields examined with the Einstein searches.\u000aDespite assertions that the PMS population in Taurus-Auriga is nearly\u000acompletely known, this x-ray survey revealed 8 new PMS objects in a region 50'\u000ain diameter, as compared to a previously known stellar population of 12\u000aobjects, including deeply embedded IRAS sources. Spectroscopic and photometric\u000aobservations enable us to place these objects in the HR Diagram. The newly\u000adiscovered objects are predominantly stars of spectral type M0 and later, and a\u000alarge fraction (6/8) appear to be surrounded by circumstellar accretion disks\u000aas judged by their infrared excess and H alpha emission. We combined the data\u000afor these x-ray discovered objects with extant and new data for the previously\u000aidentified PMS stars in this region to examine the history of star formation\u000aand the frequency distribution of stellar masses in this cloud. If the ``post\u000aROSAT'' population is either complete or representative, we conclude (1) that\u000astar formation in L1495 East took place 1 x 10^6 yrs ago and that the spread in\u000aages is small; (2) the frequency distribution of masses,\u000a

V  We discuss the optical polarization properties of X-ray selected BL Lacertae\u000aobjects (XSBLs) as determined from three years of monitoring 37 BL Lac objects\u000aand candidates. The observed objects include a complete X-ray flux limited\u000asample drawn from the EMS Survey. The majority of the XSBLs classi- fied solely\u000aon the appearance of their spectra are members of the class of BL~Lacs since\u000athey possess intrinsically polarized and variable continua. The duty cycle of\u000apolarized emission from XSBLs is 40\u005c%. The majority of XSBLs ($\u005capprox 85$\u005c%)\u000ahave preferred polarization position angles on time scales as long as three\u000ayears. This reflects stability in the geometry of the region emitting the\u000apolarized optical emission. We discuss the observed spectral dependence of the\u000adegree of polarization and some of the possible mechanisms for producing the\u000aobserved characteristics. While dilution of the polarized emission by the host\u000agalaxy starlight is present in some objects, we demon- strate that the average\u000apolarization properties derived from our observations are not drastically\u000aaffected by this effect. The objects in our monitored sample did not display\u000athe larger than one magnitude variations generally used to characterize the\u000aoptical variability of blazars in general.\u000a

V  The measurements of the possible gravitational microlensing events are\u000aanalysed with a simple yet accurate disc--halo model of the Milky Way Galaxy.\u000aThis comprises a luminous exponential disc embedded in a flattened dark matter\u000ahalo with density varying like ${\u005crm distance}^{-1.8}$. Including a disc has\u000athe important effect of lowering the implied masses of the dark matter objects.\u000aFor the possible detection reported by Alcock et al (1993), the inferred mass\u000aof the lens lies in the range $\u005csim 0.01 - 0.15 M_\u005codot$. The candidate events\u000aof Aubourg et al (1993) have slightly larger implied masses of $\u005csim 0.025 -\u000a0.35\u005c M_\u005codot$ and $\u005csim 0.03 - 0.45\u005c M_\u005codot$ respectively. These are\u000aconsistent with the deflecters being either brown dwarfs or low mass stars. If\u000athere is no disc dark matter and the halo is completely composed of baryonic\u000adark objects of typical mass $ \u005csim 0.08\u005c M_\u005codot$, then the monitoring of $1.8\u000a\u005ctimes 10^6$ stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud will provide at least $8-9$\u000adetections a year, in the limit of $100 \u005c%$ efficiency.\u000a

V  Models of our galaxy based on dynamical observations predict a spheroid\u000acomponent much heavier than accounted for by direct measurements of star counts\u000aand high velocity stars. If, as first suggested by Caldwell and Ostriker, this\u000adiscrepancy is due to a large population of faint low-mass stars or dark\u000aobjects in the spheroid, the spheroid could be responsible for microlensing\u000aevents for sources in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We show that, although\u000athe rate of events is lower than predicted by a galactic halo made of\u000amicrolensing objects, it is still significant for EROS/MACHO observations.\u000aBecause of the different matter distributions in the halo and spheroid\u000acomponents, a comparison between microlensing event rates in the LMC, future\u000ameasurements of microlensing in the galactic bulge and, possibly, in M31 can\u000aprovide information about the amounts of dark objects in the different galactic\u000acomponents. If the EROS/MACHO collaborations find a deficiency with respect to\u000atheir halo expectation, when more statistics are available, their detected\u000aevents could be interpreted as coming from spheroid microlenses, allowing for a\u000agalactic halo composed entirely of non-baryonic dark matter.\u000a

V  Kouveliotou et al. (1993) recently confirmed that gamma-ray bursts are\u000abimodal in duration. In this paper we compute the statistical properties of the\u000ashort ($\u005cle 2$~s) and long ($>2$~s) bursts using a method of analysis that\u000amakes no assumption regarding the location of the bursts, whether in the Galaxy\u000aor at a cosmological distance. We find the 64 ms channel on BATSE to be more\u000asensitive to short bursts and the 1024 ms channel is more sensitive to long\u000abursts. We show that all the currently available data are consistent with the\u000asimple hypothesis that both short and long bursts have the same spatial\u000adistribution and that within each population the sources are standard candles.\u000aThe rate of short bursts is $\u005csim 0.4$ of the rate of long bursts. Although the\u000adurations of short and long gamma-ray bursts span several orders of magnitude\u000aand the total energy of a typical short burst is smaller than that of a typical\u000along burst by a factor of $\u005csim 20$, surprisingly the peak luminosities of the\u000atwo kinds of bursts are equal to within a factor of $\u005csim 2$.\u000a

In trying to understand why the temperature has this value,\u000aone is led to discover the most fundamental features of the Universe---an\u000aearly, radiation-dominated epoch, enormous entropy per nucleon, synthesis of\u000athe light elements around three minutes after the bang, and a small excess of\u000amatter over antimatter---as well as some of the most pressing issues in\u000acosmology today, the development of structure in the Universe and the\u000aidentification of the nature of the ubiquitous dark matter.\u000a

V  Within an expansion in slow-roll inflation parameters, we derive the complete\u000asecond-order expressions relating the ratio of tensor to scalar density\u000aperturbations and the spectral index of the scalar spectrum. We find that\u000a``corrections'' to previously derived formulae can dominate if the tensor to\u000ascalar ratio is small. For instance, if $V V''/(V')^2\u005cneq 1$ or if\u000a$m_{Pl}^2/(4\u005cpi) ~|V'''/V'|\u005cga 1$, where $V(\u005cphi)$ is the inflaton potential\u000aand $m_{Pl}$ is the Planck mass, then the previously used simple relations\u000abetween the indices and the tensor to scalar ratio fails. This failure occurs\u000ain particular for natural inflation, Coleman--Weinberg inflation, and\u000a``chaotic'' inflation.\u000a

V  We consider the feasibility of directly observing gravitational microlensing\u000ain extra-galactic sources, whose stars are not generally resolved. This\u000aprecludes use of the simple optical depth to microlensing formulation, which is\u000aapplicable only to resolved stars. We, instead, extend this method to consider\u000aobservational constraints, such as seeing, sky background and minimum\u000adetectable change in magnitude. Our analysis provides quantitative relations\u000abetween these constraints and the expected observational results, event\u000aduration and number of detections per year. We find that an ambitious\u000aground-based observer should detect several events per year in M31. We also\u000aconsider detection of microlensing in visual binary galaxies. We find that,\u000aalthough these objects may present hundreds of events per year, extremely short\u000adurations would yield poor prospects for observation.\u000a

V  A P3M (Particle-Particle, Particle-Mesh) algorithm to compute the\u000agravitational force on a set of particles is described. The gravitational force\u000ais computed using Fast Fourier Transforms. This leads to an incorrect force\u000awhen the distance between two particles is of the order of a grid cell. This\u000aincorrect force is subtracted exactly from all particles in parallel using\u000aconvolution with the appropriate Green's function in real space in a time of\u000aorder $N_T$, irrespective of the degree of clustering of particles. Next, the\u000acorrect $1/r^2$ force is added for all neighbouring particles in parallel,\u000aleading to an accurate algorithm which runs efficiently on a highly parallel\u000acomputer. A full force calculation for $128k$ particles on a $128^3$ grid in a\u000amildly clustered situation requires approximately 196 seconds on a $8k$\u000aConnection Machine 2 with 8MHz clock. This decreases to an estimated 9.8\u000aseconds on a full-sized $64k$ CM200.\u000a

V  There exists a class of cosmic strings that turn matter into antimatter\u000a(Alice strings). In a GUT where the unbroken gauge group contains charge\u000aconjugation ($C$), such strings form when a phase transition renders $C$ a\u000adiscrete symmetry. They become boundaries of domain walls at a later,\u000a$C$-breaking transition. These `Alice walls' are cosmologically harmless, but\u000acan play an important role in baryogenesis. We present a three-generation toy\u000amodel with scalar baryons, where a quasi-static Alice wall (or a gas of such\u000awalls) temporarily gives rise to net baryogenesis of uniform sign everywhere in\u000aspace. This becomes a permanent baryon excess if the wall shrinks away early\u000aenough.\u000a  We comment on the possible relevance of a similar mechanism to baryogenesis\u000ain a realistic $\u005csoten$ unification model, where\u000a  Alice walls would form at the scale of left-right symmetry breaking.\u000a

V  Interactions of grazing incidence, ultra high energy cosmic rays with the\u000aearth's atmosphere may provide a new method of studying energetic cosmic rays\u000awith gamma-ray satellites. It is found that these cosmic ray interactions may\u000aproduce gamma-rays on millisecond time scales which may be detectable by\u000asatellites. An extremely low gamma-ray background for transient gamma-ray\u000aevents and a large area of interaction, the earth's surface, make the scheme\u000aplausible. The effective cross section of detection of interactions for cosmic\u000arays above 10^20 eV is found to be more than two orders of magnitude higher\u000athan earth based detection techniques. This method may eventually offer an\u000aefficient way of probing this region of the cosmic ray energy spectrum where\u000aevents are scarce. In this paper, a conceptual model is presented for the\u000aproduction of short bursts of gamma-rays based on these grazing incidence\u000aencounters with the earth's atmosphere.\u000a

Concentrating on periodic long string configurations, we\u000ashow excellent correspondence for both the amplitude and spectrum of radiation.\u000aWe also find good agreement with a linearized analytic model for radiation\u000abackreaction, demonstrating that damping due to the lowest n=2 harmonic is\u000aeffective in strongly suppressing higher harmonics. This work establishes the\u000avalidity of the Kalb-Ramond action in describing low-energy global string\u000adynamics, along with the associated self-field renormalization of the equations\u000aof motion. We also describe the different nature of massive radiation from high\u000acurvature regions and the collapse and annihilation of a circular loop. As an\u000aapplication in axion models, we discuss the relative loop and long string\u000aradiation contribution to a cosmological bound on the axion mass. A parallel\u000alinearized formalism for gravitational radiation is also provided.\u000a

V  Dust is observed to form in nova ejecta. The grain temperature is determined\u000aby the diluted nova radiation field rather than the gas kinetic temperature,\u000amaking classical nucleation theory inapplicable. We used kinetic equations to\u000acalculate the growth of carbon nuclei in these ejecta. For expected values of\u000athe parameters too many clusters grew, despite the small sticking probability\u000aof atoms to small clusters, and the clusters only reached radii of about\u000a100\u005cAA\u005c when the carbon vapor was depleted. We then included the effects of\u000acluster photodissociation by ultraviolet radiation from the nova. This\u000asuppresses nucleation, but too well, and no grains form at all. Finally we\u000asuggest that a few growing carbon nuclei may be protected from\u000aphotodissociation by a sacrificial surface layer of hydrogen.\u000a

We also\u000aconsider the large-scale anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background\u000aradiation coming from these waves. Assuming that the observed quadrupole\u000aanisotropy comes mostly from gravitational waves (consistent with the\u000apredictions of a flat spectrum of scalar density perturbations and the measured\u000adipole anisotropy) we describe in detail how to derive a value for the scale of\u000ainflation of $(1.5-5)\u005ctimes 10^{16}$GeV, which is at a particularly interesting\u000ascale for particle physics. This upper limit corresponds to a 95\u005c% confidence\u000alevel upper limit on the scale of inflation assuming only that the quadrupole\u000aanisotropy from gravitational waves is not cancelled by another source. Direct\u000adetection of gravitational waves produced by inflation near this scale will\u000ahave to wait for the next generation of detectors.\u000a

V  We present the case that populations of sdB/sdOB/sdO-type stars may be a\u000acommon constituent of galactic stellar populations, responsible for the UV\u000aupturn (`UVX') observed in the spectra of spiral bulges and normal galaxy\u000anuclei. Extreme Horizontal Branch stars with $\u005clog g > 5$ and $\u005clog \u005cteff >\u000a20,000K$ have emerged in the last few years as the most likely candidate for\u000athe origin of the UVX. The magnitude of this far-UV flux in some systems (e.g.\u000aNGC~1399, NGC~4649) indicates that galactic nuclear regions must contain larger\u000anumbers of these subdwarfs than does the solar neighbourhood. This paper\u000asummarizes the results of a quantitative study of the UV radiation from evolved\u000astellar populations. We have computed a large grid of stellar models in\u000aadvanced stages of evolution, as well as a set of isochrones for ages 2-20 Gyr,\u000afor a wide range in composition. We use these calculations to derive synthetic\u000aUV colour indices for stellar populations with hot components.\u000a

V  We develop a general method for power spectrum analysis of three dimensional\u000aredshift surveys. We present rigorous analytical estimates for the statistical\u000auncertainty in the power and we are able to derive a rigorous optimal weighting\u000ascheme under the reasonable (and largely empirically verified) assumption that\u000athe long wavelength Fourier components are Gaussian distributed. We apply the\u000aformalism to the updated 1-in-6 QDOT IRAS redshift survey, and compare our\u000aresults to data from other probes: APM angular correlations; the CfA and the\u000aBerkeley 1.2Jy IRAS redshift surveys. Our results bear out and further quantify\u000athe impression from e.g.\u005c counts-in-cells analysis that there is extra power on\u000alarge scales as compared to the standard CDM model with $\u005cOmega h\u005csimeq 0.5$.\u000aWe apply likelihood analysis using the CDM spectrum with $\u005cOmega h$ as a free\u000aparameter as a phenomenological family of models; we find the best fitting\u000aparameters in redshift space and transform the results to real space. Finally,\u000awe calculate the distribution of the estimated long wavelength power. This\u000aagrees remarkably well with the exponential distribution expected for Gaussian\u000afluctuations, even out to powers of ten times the mean. Our results thus reveal\u000ano trace of periodicity or other non-Gaussian behavior.\u000a

V  We study stochastic inflation in the presence of a dynamical gravitational\u000aconstant. We describe the Arnowitt--Deser--Misner formalism for\u000aJordan--Brans--Dicke theory of gravity with an inflaton field. The inflaton and\u000adilaton scalar fields can be separated into coarse-grained background fields\u000aand quantum fluctuations. We compute the amplitude of the perturbations\u000agenerated by those quantum fluctuations in JBD theory with an arbitrary\u000apotential for the inflaton field. The effect of the quantum fluctuations on the\u000abackground fields is equivalent to a Brownian motion of the scalar fields,\u000awhich can be described with the use of a Fokker--Planck diffusion equation. The\u000aprobability to find a given value of the fields in the comoving frame can be\u000awritten as a Gaussian distribution centered on their classical trajectory, with\u000adecreasing dispersion along both field directions. We also calculate the\u000acondition for the Universe to enter a self-regenerating inflationary phase. The\u000aprobability distribution in the physical frame, which takes into account the\u000aexpansion of the proper volume of the inflationary domains, will be\u000aconcentrated at the Planck boundary and will move along it towards large values\u000aof the fields.\u000a

V  This review concentrates almost entirely on globular star clusters. It\u000aemphasises the increasing realisation that few of the traditional problems of\u000astar cluster astronomy can be studied in isolation: the influence of the Galaxy\u000aaffects dynamical evolution deep in the core, and the spectrum of stellar\u000amasses; in turn the evolution of the core determines the highest stellar\u000adensities, and the rate of encounters. In this way external tidal effects\u000aindirectly influence the formation and evolution of blue stragglers, binary\u000apulsars, X-ray sources, etc. More controversially, the stellar density appears\u000ato influence the relative distribution of normal stars. In the opposite sense,\u000athe evolution of individual stars governs much of the early dynamics of a\u000aglobular cluster, and the existence of large numbers of primordial binary stars\u000ahas changed important details of our picture of the dynamical evolution. New\u000acomputational tools which will become available in the next few years will help\u000adynamical theorists to address these questions.\u000a

V  Focus of these lectures is the challenge of explaining the origin of\u000astructure in the Universe. The interplay between quantum field theory and\u000aclassical general relativity has given rise to several interesting cosmological\u000amodels which contain mechanisms for generating density inhomogeneities. The\u000athree theories discussed here are the inflationary Universe, the cosmic string\u000aand the global texture models. The recent COBE discovery of anisotropies in the\u000amicrowave background has provided some support for all three models. The\u000apresent results do not allow a distinction between these models. Statistics\u000awhich distinguish between the predictions of the three theories are discussed.\u000a

V  The appearance of two geometries in one and the same gravitational theory is\u000afamiliar. Usually, as in the Brans-Dicke theory or in string theory, these are\u000aconformally related Riemannian geometries. Is this the most general relation\u000abetween the two geometries allowed by physics ? We study this question by\u000asupposing that the physical geometry on which matter dynamics take place could\u000abe Finslerian rather than just Riemannian. An appeal to the weak equivalence\u000aprinciple and causality then leads us the conclusion that the Finsler geometry\u000ahas to reduce to a Riemann geometry whose metric - the physical metric - is\u000arelated to the gravitational metric by a generalization of the conformal\u000atransformation.\u000a

V  We use the Expanding Photosphere Method to determine distances to 10 type II\u000asupernovae. The effects of asymmetries, extinction, and flux dilution are\u000aexplored. Using empirical evidence and time-independent, spherical models which\u000atreat H and He in non-LTE, we show that blackbody corrections caused by flux\u000adilution are small for type II supernovae in the infrared, and in the optical\u000awhen their color temperatures are less than 6000~K. The extinction to a type\u000aII-P supernova can be estimated from its light curve: the uncertainty\u000aintroduced into a distance measurement due to extinction is usually less than\u000a10\u005c%. Correcting for extinction and flux dilution we derive distances to 10\u000asupernovae: SN 1968L, SN 1969L, SN 1970G, SN 1973R, SN 1979C, SN 1980K, SN\u000a1987A, SN 1988A, SN 1990E, and SN 1990ae. The distance measurements span a wide\u000arange, 50 kpc to 120 Mpc, which is unique among the methods for establishing\u000athe extragalactic distance scale. The distances measured to SN 1970G in M101\u000aand SN 1987A in the LMC are in good agreement with distances determined from\u000aCepheid variable stars. Our distance to the Virgo Cluster, 22 +- 3 Mpc, is\u000alarger than recent distances estimates made using surface brightness\u000afluctuations, planetary nebula luminosity functions, and the Tully-Fisher\u000amethod. Using the distances determined from these type II supernovae we derive\u000aa value of $H_0 = 60 \u005cpm 10$ km sec$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$. This value is subject to\u000aerrors caused by local deviations in the Hubble flow, but will soon be improved\u000aby applying the Expanding Photosphere Method to several distant type II\u000asupernovae.\u000a

We investigate analytically the\u000a{\u005cit Fourier space} statistical properties of temperature or density\u000afluctuation patterns generated by seed-like objects and compare these\u000aproperties with those of Gaussian fluctuations generated during inflation.\u000a  We show that the proposed statistical test can easily identify temperature\u000afluctuations produced by a superposition of a small number of seeds per horizon\u000ascale for {\u005cit any} observational angular resolution and {\u005cit any} seed\u000ageometry. However, due to the Central Limit Theorem, the distinction becomes\u000amore difficult as the number of seeds in the fluctuation pattern increases.\u000a

V  We use numerical simulations to calculate the cosmic microwave background\u000aanisotropy induced by the evolution of a global texture field, with special\u000aemphasis on individual textures. Both spherically symmetric and general\u000aconfigurations are analysed, and in the latter case we consider field\u000aconfigurations which exhibit unwinding events and also ones which do not. We\u000acompare the results given by evolving the field numerically under both the\u000aexpanded core (XCORE) and non-linear sigma model (NLSM) approximations with the\u000aanalytic predictions of the NLSM exact solution for a spherically symmetric\u000aself-similar (SSSS) unwinding. We find that the random unwinding configuration\u000aspots' typical peak height is 60--75\u005c% and angular size typically only 10\u005c% of\u000athose of the SSSS unwinding, and that random configurations without an\u000aunwinding event nonetheless may generate indistinguishable hot and cold spots.\u000aThe influence of these results on analytic estimates of texture induced\u000amicrowave anisotropies is examined, and comparison made with other numerical\u000awork.\u000a

V  We present a detailed comparison of the simulation results of various\u000acosmological hydrodynamic codes. Starting with identical initial conditions\u000abased on the Cold Dark Matter scenario for the growth of structure, we\u000aintegrate from redshift $z=20$ to $z=0$ to determine the physical state within\u000aa representative volume of size $L^3$ where $L=64 h^{-1} {\u005crm Mpc}$. Five\u000aindependent codes are compared: three of them Eulerian mesh based and two\u000avariants of the Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics "SPH" Lagrangian approach. The\u000aEulerian codes were run at $N^3=(32^3,~64^3,~128^3,~{\u005crm and},~256^3)$ cells,\u000athe SPH codes at $N^3= 32^3$ and $64^3$ particles. Results were then rebinned\u000ato a $16^3$ grid with the expectation that the rebinned data should converge,\u000aby all techniques, to a common and correct result as $N \u005crightarrow \u005cinfty$. We\u000afind that global averages of various physical quantities do, as expected, tend\u000ato converge in the rebinned model, but that uncertainties in even primitive\u000aquantities such as $\u005clangle T \u005crangle$, $\u005clangle \u005crho^2\u005crangle^{1/2}$ persists\u000aat the 3\u005c%-17\u005c% level after completion of very large simulations. The two SPH\u000acodes and the two shock capturing Eulerian codes achieve comparable and\u000asatisfactory accuracy for comparable computer time in their treatment of the\u000ahigh density, high temperature regions as measured in the rebinned data; the\u000avariance among the five codes (at highest resolution) for the mean temperature\u000a(as weighted by $\u005crho^2$) is only 4.5\u005c%. Overall the comparison allows us to\u000abetter estimate errors, it points to ways of improving this current generation\u000aof hydrodynamic codes and of suiting their use to problems which exploit their\u000aindividually best features.\u000a

V  As a first step of a program aimed to the detection of dark matter (or radial\u000avariations of M/L) in early-type galaxies, we report deep spectroscopic\u000aobservations of the bulge-dominated edge-on S0 galaxy NGC 3115, made at ESO, La\u000aSilla, using EFOSC at the 3.6m telescope and EMMI at NTT. Such observations\u000aallow measurements of the rotational velocity out to 1.8 a_e (effective radii)\u000afrom the galaxy center, where the surface brightness is \u005cmu_B ~ 24 mag\u000aarcsec**-2. The rotation curve quickly reaches an asymptotic value, v_f ~ 260\u000akm/s, with only marginal indication of systematic decline within the range of\u000aour observations. The line-of-sight velocity dispersion has also been measured;\u000ait decreases steeply from a rather high central value and flattens out\u000a(<\u005csigma> ~ 100 km/s) within our observing range (a ~< 1.3 a_e). Models built\u000aon these data and simple dynamical arguments show that the M/L of NGC 3115 must\u000athus be increasing from M/L = 6 (in solar units) in the inner regions (~ 1 a_e)\u000ato at least M/L >= 10 in the outermost regions (~ 2 a_e).\u000a

V  Hadronic axions with the decay constant $f_a\u005csimeq 10^{6}$ GeV may fulfill\u000aall astrophysical and laboratory constraints discussed so far. In this paper,\u000awe reexamine the possibility of the hadronic axion window while taking into\u000aaccount the uncertainties of some parameters describing low energy axion\u000adynamics. It is found that $f_a$ in the range from $3\u005ctimes 10^5$ GeV to\u000a$3\u005ctimes 10^6$ can not be excluded by existing arguments. We then examine the\u000aimplication of this hadronic axion window for the big-bang nucleosynthesis (NS)\u000aby evaluating the energy density of thermal axions at the nucleosynthesis\u000aepoch. Our analysis yields $(\u005crho_a/\u005crho_{\u005cnu})_{NS}=0.4\u005csim 0.5$ which exceeds\u000aslightly the current best bound $(\u005crho_a/\u005crho_{\u005cnu})_{NS}\u005cleq 0.3$.\u000a

V  A new, three-dimensional, shock capturing, TVD hydrodynamic code is utilized\u000ato determine the distribution of hot gas in a CDM$+\u005cLambda$ model universe.\u000aThis open model succeeds in matching local observations of clusters in contrast\u000ato the standard $\u005cOmega=1$, CDM model, which fails. It predicts an order of\u000amagnitude decline in the number density of bright ($h\u005cnu = 2-10$keV) clusters\u000afrom $z=0$ to $z=2$ in contrast to a slight increase in the number density for\u000astandard $\u005cOmega=1$, CDM model. This COBE-normalized CDM$+\u005cLambda$ model\u000aproduces approximately the same number of X-ray clusters having\u000a$L_x>10^{43}$erg/s as observed. The number density of bright clusters increases\u000ato $z\u005csim 0.2-0.5$ and declines, but the luminosity per typical cluster\u000adecreases monotonically with redshift, with the result that the number density\u000aof bright clusters shows a broad peak near $z=0.5$, and then a rapid decline as\u000a$z\u005crightarrow 3$. The most interesting point which we find is that the\u000atemperatures of clusters in this model freeze out at later times ($z\u005cle 0.3$),\u000awhile previously we found in the CDM model that there was a steep increase\u000aduring the same interval of redshift. The trend should be detectable even with\u000aa relatively ``soft" X-ray instrument such as ROSAT, providing a powerful\u000adiscriminant between $\u005cOmega=1$ and $\u005cOmega<1$ models. Examining the ratio of\u000agas-to-total mass in the clusters, we find a slight antibias ($b=0.9$ or\u000a$({\u005cOmega_{gas}\u005cover\u005cOmega_{tot}})_{cl} =0.083\u005cpm 0.007$), which is consistent\u000awith observations [$({\u005cOmega_{gas}\u005cover\u005cOmega_{tot}})_{obs}=0.097\u005cpm 0.019$ for\u000athe Coma cluster for the given value of $h$, \u005ccf, White 1991].\u000a

V  We investigate the possibility that inhomogeneous nucleosynthesis may\u000aeventually be used to explain the abundances of \u005cli6, \u005cbe9 and B in population\u000aII stars. The present work differs from previous studies in that we have used a\u000amore extensive reaction network. It is demonstrated that in the simplest\u000ascenario the abundances of the light elements with $A\u005cle7$ constrain the\u000aseparation of inhomogeneities to sufficiently small scales that the model is\u000aindistinguishable from homogeneous nucleosynthesis and that the abundances of\u000a\u005cli6, \u005cbe9\u005c and B are then below observations by several orders of magnitude.\u000aThis conclusion does not depend on the \u005cli7 constraint. We also examine\u000aalternative scenarios which involve a post-nucleosynthesis reprocessing of the\u000alight elements to reproduce the observed abundances of Li and B, while allowing\u000afor a somewhat higher baryon density (still well below the cosmological\u000acritical density). Future B/H measurements may be able to exclude even this\u000aexotic scenario and further restrict primordial nucleosynthesis to approach the\u000ahomogeneous model conclusions.\u000a

V  Gravitino production and decay in the inflationary universe are reexanimed.\u000aAssuming that gravitino mainly decays into photon and photino, we have\u000acalculated the upperbound of the reheating temperature. Compared to previous\u000aworks, we have essentially improved the following two points; (i) the helicity\u000a$\u005cpm\u005cfrac{3}{2}$ gravitino production cross sections are calculated by using\u000athe full relevant terms in the supergravity lagrangian, and (ii) high energy\u000aphoton spectrum is obtained by solving the Boltzmann equations numerically.\u000aPhoto-dissociation of the light elements (D, T, $^3$He, $^4$He) leads to the\u000amost stringent upperbound of the reheating temperature, which is given by\u000a($10^{6}$--$10^{9}$)GeV for the gravitino mass 100GeV--1TeV. On the other hand,\u000arequiring that the present mass density of photino should be smaller than the\u000acritical density, we find that the reheating temperature have to be smaller\u000athan ($10^{11}$--$10^{12}$)GeV for the photino mass (10--100)GeV,\u000airrespectively of the gravitino mass. The effect of other decay channel is also\u000aconsidered.\u000a

V  The presence of an obscuring torus around the nucleus of Seyfert galaxies, as\u000asupposed in the popular unification scheme, can strongly modify the X--ray\u000aspectrum for both type 1 and 2 Seyfert galaxies. We find that if the torus is\u000aCompton thick, it can scatter at small angles a significant fraction of the\u000anuclear radiation, and contribute to the continuum of Seyfert 1 galaxies above\u000a$\u005csim$10 keV, and to the fluorescence iron line at 6.4 keV. At large\u000ainclination angles and for large torus column densities, the spectrum is\u000aattenuated by photoabsorption and Compton scattering, while the iron\u000afluorescence line produced by the torus can have large equivalent widths. Even\u000aafter dilution by the continuum scattered by the warm material outside the\u000atorus, this iron line could be strong enough to explain the ``cold" component\u000ain the spectrum of NGC 1068. We stress that the complex pattern of the\u000apredicted variability can be a powerful tool for constraining the parameters of\u000athe model, such as the column density of the torus, its inclination and the\u000aamount of warm scattering material.\u000a

V  This paper presents a general-relativistic N-body technique for evolving the\u000aphase space distribution of massive neutrinos in linear perturbation theory.\u000aThe method provides a much more accurate sampling of the neutrino phase space\u000afor the HDM initial conditions of N-body simulations in a cold+hot dark matter\u000auniverse than previous work. Instead of directly sampling the phase space at\u000athe end of the linear era, we first compute the evolution of the metric\u000aperturbations by numerically integrating the coupled, linearized Einstein,\u000aBoltzmann, and fluid equations for all particle species. We then sample the\u000aphase space shortly after neutrino decoupling at redshift z=10^9 when the\u000adistribution is Fermi-Dirac. To follow the trajectory of each neutrino, we\u000asubsequently integrate the geodesic equations for each neutrino in the\u000aperturbed background spacetime from z=10^9 to z=13.55, using the linearized\u000ametric found in the previous calculation to eliminate discreteness noise. The\u000apositions and momenta resulting from this integration represent a fair sample\u000aof the full neutrino phase space and can be used as HDM initial conditions for\u000aN-body simulations of nonlinear structure evolution in this model. A total of\u000a21 million neutrino particles are used in a 100 Mpc box, with Omega_cdm=0.65,\u000aOmega_hdm=0.30, Omega_baryon=0.05, and Hubble constant H_0=50. We find that\u000acorrelations develop in the neutrino densities and momenta which are absent\u000awhen only the zeroth-order Fermi-Dirac distribution is considered.\u000a

V  We derive the volume-averaged 2, 3, 4, and 5-point correlation functions from\u000athe moments of the Count probability distribution function of a redshift survey\u000aof IRAS galaxies, and find them all to be reasonably well-described by power\u000alaws. Weak systematic effects with the sample size provide evidence for\u000astronger clustering of galaxies of higher luminosity on small scales.\u000aNevertheless, remarkably tight relationships hold between the correlation\u000afunctions of different order. In particular, the ``normalized" skewness defined\u000aby the ratio $S_3\u005cequiv \u005cbar{\u005cxi_3} / \u005cbar{\u005cxi_2}^2$ varies at most weakly with\u000ascale in the range $0.1 < \u005cbar{\u005cxi_2} < 10$. That is, $S_3$ is close to\u000aconstant ($=1.5\u005cpm 0.5$) from weakly to strongly non-linear scales.\u000aFurthermore, we find that the void probability function obeys a scaling\u000arelation with density to great precision, in accord with the scale-invariance\u000ahypothesis ($\u005cbar{\u005cxi_N}\u005cpropto\u005cbar{\u005cxi_2}^{N-1}$).\u000a

By a maximum likelihood analysis applied separately on these\u000asamples we obtain estimates of $\u005csigma^2(\u005cell)$, with $\u005cell \u005cequiv V_u^{1/3}$.\u000aThe analysis from a single catalog for $\u005cell = ~40~h^{-1}$ Mpc and from a\u000asuitable average over the three catalogs for $\u005cell = ~60,~80$ and $100~h^{-1}$\u000aMpc, gives $\u005csigma^2(\u005cell) = 0.46^{+0.27}_{-0.27}$, $0.18^{+0.14}_{-0.15}$,\u000a$0.05^{+0.14}_{-0.05}$ and $0.12^{+0.13}_{-0.12}$, respectively, where the\u000a$70\u005c%$ confidence ranges account for both sampling errors and statistical\u000afluctuations in the counts. This allows a comparison of QSO clustering on large\u000ascales with analogous data recently obtained both for optical and IRAS\u000agalaxies: QSOs seem to be more clustered than these galaxies by a biasing\u000afactor $b_{QSO}/b_{gal} \u005csim 1.4 - 2.3$.\u000a

V  We have performed a series of three-dimensional hydrodynamic calculations of\u000abinary coalescence using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. The\u000ainitial conditions are exact polytropic equilibrium configurations with $\u005cgam >\u000a5/3$, on the verge of dynamical instability. We calculate the emission of\u000agravitational radiation in the quadrupole approximation. The fully nonlinear\u000adevelopment of the instability is followed until a new equilibrium\u000aconfiguration is reached. We find that the properties of this final\u000aconfiguration depend sensitively on both the compressibility and mass ratio. An\u000a{\u005cem axisymmetric} merged configuration is always produced when $\u005cgam\u005clo2.3$.\u000aAs a consequence, the emission of gravitational radiation shuts off abruptly\u000aright after the onset of dynamical instability. In contrast, {\u005cem triaxial\u005c/}\u000amerged configurations are obtained when $\u005cgam\u005cgo2.3$, and the system continues\u000ato emit gravitational waves after the final coalescence. Systems with mass\u000aratios $q\u005cne1$ typically become dynamically unstable before the onset of mass\u000atransfer. Stable mass transfer from one neutron star to another in a close\u000abinary is therefore probably ruled out. The maximum amplitude $h_{max}$ and\u000apeak luminosity $L_{max}$ of the gravitational waves emitted during the final\u000acoalescence are nearly independent of $\u005cgam$, but depend very sensitively on\u000athe mass ratio $q$.\u000a

V  Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) discretization techniques are\u000ageneralized to develop a method, smoothed particle interpolation (SPI), for\u000asolving initial value problems of systems of non-hydrodynamical nature. Under\u000athis approach, SPH is viewed as strictly an interpolation scheme and, as such,\u000asuitable for solving general hyperbolic and parabolic equations. The SPI method\u000ais tested on (1) the wave equation with inhomogeneous sound speed and (2)\u000aBurgers equation. The efficiency of SPI is studied by comparing SPI solutions\u000ato those obtained with standard finite difference methods. It is shown that the\u000apower of SPI arises when the smoothing particles are free to move.\u000a

V  We present results showing an improvement of the accuracy of perturbation\u000atheory as applied to cosmological structure formation for a useful range of\u000ascales. The Lagrangian theory of gravitational instability of\u000aFriedmann--Lema\u005c^\u005ci tre cosmogonies investigated and solved up to the third\u000aorder in the series of papers by Buchert (1989, 1992, 1993), Buchert \u005c& Ehlers\u000a(1993), Buchert (1994), Ehlers \u005c& Buchert (1994), is compared with numerical\u000asimulations. In this paper we study the dynamics of hierarchical models as a\u000asecond step. In the first step (Buchert, Melott and Wei{\u005css} 1994) we analyzed\u000athe performance of the Lagrangian schemes for pancake models, i.e., models\u000awhich initially have a truncated power spectrum. We here explore whether the\u000aresults found for pancake models carry over to hierarchical models which are\u000aevolved deeply into the non--linear regime............We find that for spectra\u000awith negative power--index the second--order scheme performs considerably\u000abetter than TZA in terms of statistics which probe the dynamics, and slightly\u000abetter in terms of low--order statistics like the power--spectrum. In cases\u000awith much small--scale power the gain from the higher--order schemes is small,\u000abut still measurable. However, in contrast to the results found for pancake\u000amodels, where the higher--order schemes get worse than TZA at late non--linear\u000astages and on small scales, we here find that the second--order model is as\u000arobust as TZA, retaining the improvement at later stages and on smaller scales.\u000aIn view of these\u000a

V  We apply fractal analysis methods to investigate the scaling properties in\u000athe Abell and ACO catalogs of rich galaxy clusters. We also discuss different\u000atechnical aspects of the method when applied to data sets with small number of\u000apoints as the cluster catalogs. Results are compared with simulations based on\u000athe Zel'dovich approximation. We limit our analysis to scales less than 100\u000a$\u005chm$. The cluster distribution show a scale invariant multifractal behavior in\u000aa limited scale range. For the Abell catalog this range is 15--60$\u005chm$, while\u000afor the ACO sample it extends to smaller scales. Despite this difference in the\u000aextension of the scale--range where scale--invariant clustering takes place,\u000aboth samples are characterized by remarkably similar multifractal spectra in\u000athe corresponding scaling regime. In particular, the correlation dimension\u000aturns out to be $D_2\u005csimeq 2.2$ for both Abell and ACO clusters. Although it is\u000adifficult to point out the scale at which homogeneity is reached with the\u000apresent size of these redshift surveys, our results indicate that the cluster\u000adistribution shows a tendency to homogeneity at large scales, disproving the\u000apicture of a pure scale invariant fractal structure extending to arbitrarily\u000alarge distances.\u000a

V  We calculate reduced moments $\u005coverline \u005cxi_q$ of the matter density\u000afluctuations, up to order $q=5$, from counts in cells produced by\u000aParticle--Mesh numerical simulations with scale--free Gaussian initial\u000aconditions. We use power--law spectra $P(k) \u005cpropto k^n$ with indices\u000a$n=-3,~-2,~-1,~0,~1$. Due to the supposed absence of characteristic times or\u000ascales in our models, all quantities are expected to depend on a single scaling\u000avariable. For each model, the moments at all times can be expressed in terms of\u000athe variance $\u005coverline \u005cxi_2$, alone. We look for agreement with the\u000ahierarchical scaling ansatz, according to which $\u005coverline \u005cxi_q \u005cpropto\u000a\u005coverline \u005cxi_2^{~q-1}$. For $n\u005cleq -2$ models we find strong deviations from\u000athe hierarchy, which are mostly due to the presence of boundary problems in the\u000asimulations. A small, residual signal of deviation from the hierarchical\u000ascaling is however also found in $n \u005cgeq -1$ models. For the first time, due to\u000aour large dynamic range and careful checks of scaling and shot--noise effects,\u000awe are able to detect evolution away from the perturbation theory result.\u000a

V  A comprehensive study of the effect of an unstable tau neutrino on primordial\u000anucleosynthesis is presented. The standard code for nucleosynthesis is modified\u000ato allow for a massive decaying tau neutrino whose daughter products include\u000aneutrinos, photons, $e^\u005cpm$ pairs, and/or noninteracting (sterile) daughter\u000aproducts. Tau-neutrino decays influence primordial nucleosynthesis in three\u000adistinct ways: (i) the energy density of the decaying tau neutrino and its\u000adaughter products affect the expansion rate tending to increase $^4$He, D, and\u000a$^3$He production; (ii) electromagnetic (EM) decay products heat the EM plasma\u000aand dilute the baryon-to-photon ratio tending to decrease $^4$He production and\u000aincrease D and $^3$He production; and (iii) electron neutrinos and\u000aantineutrinos produced by tau-neutrino decays increase the weak rates that\u000agovern the neutron-to-proton ratio, leading to decreased $^4$He production for\u000ashort lifetimes ($\u005cla 30\u005csec$) and masses less than about $10\u005cMeV$ and\u000aincreased $^4$He production for long lifetimes or large masses. The precise\u000aeffect of a decaying tau neutrino on the yields of primordial nucleosynthesis\u000aand the mass-lifetime limits that follow depend crucially upon decay mode. We\u000aidentify four generic decay modes that serve to bracket the wider range of\u000apossibilities:\u000a

V  The cosmological features of primordial black holes formed from collapsed\u000acosmic string loops are studied. Observational restrictions on a population of\u000aprimordial black holes are used to restrict $f$, the fraction of cosmic string\u000aloops which collapse to form black holes, and $\u005cmu$, the cosmic string\u000amass-per-unit-length. Using a realistic model of cosmic strings, we find the\u000astrongest restriction on the parameters $f$ and $\u005cmu$ is due to the energy\u000adensity in $100 MeV$ photons radiated by the black holes. We also find that\u000ainert black hole remnants cannot serve as the dark matter. If earlier, crude\u000aestimates of $f$ are reliable, our results severely restrict $\u005cmu$, and\u000atherefore limit the viability of the cosmic string large-scale structure\u000ascenario.\u000a

V  We develop a theory to account for the cosmic ray spectrum between 1 GeV and\u000a10^4 GeV following the earlier papers of this series. We use the basic concept\u000athat the cosmic ray particles are accelerated in a supernova shock that travels\u000athrough the interstellar medium. Physically important ingredients besides the\u000apresence of a strong shock are diffusion, drifts, convection, adiabatic\u000acooling, the injection history, and the topology of the magnetic field, here\u000aassumed for simplicity to be homogeneous in the interstellar medium. The result\u000ais a spectrum, which for strong shocks in a gas with adiabatic index 5/3 yields\u000aa spectrum of E^-2.42. Interstellar turbulence with a Kolmogorov spectrum then\u000aleads by leakage from the galactic disk to a spectrum which is E^-2.75, as\u000aobserved. We argue that the ratio of cosmic ray electrons to protons is\u000adetermined by the amount of expansion which takes place from the cessation of\u000aelectron injection to the break-up of the shell by cooling instabilities. Since\u000athe highest particle energy reached derives from geometrical arguments, it\u000adepends on the charge of the nucleus and so higher Z elements are predicted to\u000areach higher energies.\u000a

V  The cold dark matter (CDM) model of structure formation, normalized on large\u000ascales, leads to excessive pairwise velocity dispersions on small scales. In an\u000aattempt to circumvent this problem, we study three scenarios (all with\u000a$\u005cOmega=1$) which have more large-scale power and less small-scale power than\u000athe CDM model: 1) an admixture of cold and hot dark matter; 2) cold dark matter\u000awith a non-scale-invariant, power-law primordial power spectrum; and 3) cold\u000adark matter with coupling of dark matter to a long-range vector field. Despite\u000athe {reduced} small-scale power, when such models are evolved in the nonlinear\u000aregime to large amplitude, the velocities on small scales are actually {\u005cit\u000aincreased} over CDM with the same value of $\u005csigma_8$. This `flip-over', in\u000adisagreement with the expectation from linear perturbation theory, arises from\u000athe nonlinear coupling of the extra power on large scales with shorter\u000awavelengths. However, due to the extra large-scale power, the recent COBE DMR\u000aresults indicate smaller amplitudes for these models, $\u005csigma_8 \u005csim 0.5 -\u000a0.7$, than for CDM (for which $\u005csigma_8 \u005csim 1.2$). Therefore, when normalized\u000ato COBE on large scales, such models do lead to reduced velocities on small\u000ascales and they produce fewer halos compared with CDM. Quantitatively it seems,\u000ahowever, that models that produce sufficiently low small-scale velocities fail\u000ato produce an adequate distribution of halos.\u000a

V  To test whether clusters have rising mass to light ratios at large radii and\u000ato estimate the amplitude of the density fluctuation spectrum on the scale of\u000a10\u005chmpc\u005c the Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology (CNOC) cluster\u000acollaboration is obtaining Multi-Object Spectrograph velocities and two colour\u000aphotometry for a sample of $\u005csimeq$1000 cluster galaxies and $\u005csimeq$2000 field\u000agalaxies in a 5\u005chmpc\u005c neighborhood of high X-ray luminosity clusters at\u000a$z\u005csimeq 0.3$. X-ray selection of the cluster sample picks out objects on the\u000abasis of the depth of their potential well depth, and is insensitive to both\u000aprojection effects and galaxy biases. The galaxy dataset, with selection\u000acontrolled using automated photometry, automated mask design, spectral\u000aselection modeling, and accurate velocities, will be the best available at any\u000aredshift for our tests. Measuring mass-to-light ratios (M/L) at large radii\u000arequires a statistical removal of field galaxies projected into the redshift\u000aspace of the cluster. This can be done relatively accurately for moderate\u000aredshift clusters, using the large number of foreground and background\u000agalaxies. The CNOC sample also provides a sensitive test of the density\u000afluctuation spectrum on cluster scales. The 30 or so redshifts available in\u000aeach of three clusters gives an average velocity dispersion of about 1000 \u005ckms\u000awhich indicates that the $\u005csigma_8$ normalization parameter is in the range of\u000a$0.6\u005clta \u005csigma_8\u005clta 0.9$.\u000a

V  We show that HI clouds in the Magellanic Clouds are stripped by the\u000aram-pressure due to the halo and disk gases of the Galaxy. Molecular clouds are\u000aswept to the edge of the LMC, showing an eccentric distribution. The stripped\u000aHI clouds form a narrow band on the sky, and mimics the Magellanic Stream, when\u000athe LMC takes a polar orbit. We point out that the Magellanic Stream will fall\u000ainto the Galaxy, and will be finally accreted by the Galactic disk. The\u000aaccretion may cause warping of the inner gas disk of the Galaxy. Some clouds\u000aare accreted by the nuclear disk, which could explain the peculiar distribution\u000aand kinematics in the central region. The stripping of the interstellar gas\u000afrom the Magellanic Clouds will rapidly change their morphological type into\u000adwarf ellipticals.\u000a

V  We show that seeds for quasar black holes could have originated from the\u000ainitial cosmological collapse of overdense regions with unusually small\u000arotation. The gas in these rare regions collapses into a compact disk that\u000ashrinks on a short viscous time scale. Using an analytical model, we calculate\u000athe low-spin tail of the probability distribution of angular momenta for\u000aobjects that collapse out of a Gaussian random field of initial density\u000aperturbations. The population of low-spin systems is significant for any viable\u000apower spectrum of primordial density perturbations. Most objects form just\u000aabove the cosmological Jeans mass (\u005csim 10^5 M_sun) at high redshifts z>10. In\u000athe standard cold dark matter cosmology, the comoving density of 10^{6-7} M_sun\u000aobjects with viscous evolution times shorter than 10^{6-7} years is about\u000a10^{-3} (h/0.5)^3 Mpc^{-3}, comparable to the local density of bright galaxies.\u000aThe seed black holes tend to reside within larger mass systems that collapse\u000alater and supply the gas needed for the bright quasar activity.\u000a

V  We mapped quiescent 807 GHz CO(7-6) emission from Orion along a strip in RA\u000aextending from 0.7 pc west to 1.2 pc east of Ori theta 1C. The lines arise in\u000awarm gas with T > 40 K. The line brightness temperature is > 160 K in the di-\u000arection of theta 1C, more than twice the dust temperature, and still exceeds 35\u000aK more than a parsec east of theta 1C. The lines are narrow, with a max- imum\u000avelocity width of 7 km s^-1 near theta 1C and decreasing to 1.5-3 km s^-1 at\u000athe map boundaries. The density of the emitting gas is > 10^4 cm^-3 and the\u000acolumn density exceeds 10^21 cm^-2. The correlation of the bright, narrow\u000aCO(7-6) lines with 158 micron [C II] emission suggests that over the entire\u000aregion mapped, the narrow CO lines arise in warm photo-dissociation regions ex-\u000acited by UV photons from the Trapezium cluster. Although the Trapezium stars\u000alie in front of the Orion A molecular cloud, not all of the warm gas is at the\u000acloud surface. To the east of theta 1C the CO(7-6) lines split into two velo-\u000acity components (also seen in 13CO(2-1) emission) which persist over several\u000aarcminutes. Since only one of these components can be on the surface, the other\u000amust arise from a dense, UV-illuminated clump or filament within the molecular\u000acloud. Comparison of the quiescent CO(7-6) emission to CO(7-6) ob- served in a\u000across-map of the energetic Orion KL outflow shows that the lumino- sity of\u000ashock-excited CO(7-6) emission in Orion is only a few percent of the luminosity\u000aof the widespread quiescent CO(7-6) emission.\u000a

V  We have searched the temperature maps from the COBE Differential Microwave\u000aRadiometers (DMR) first two years of data for evidence of unresolved sources.\u000aThe high-latitude sky (|b| > 30\u005cdeg) contains no sources brighter than 192 uK\u000athermodynamic temperature (322 Jy at 53 GHz). The cumulative count of sources\u000abrighter than threshold T, N(> T), is consistent with a superposition of\u000ainstrument noise plus a scale-invariant spectrum of cosmic temperature\u000afluctuations normalized to Qrms-PS = 17 uK. We examine the temperature maps\u000atoward nearby clusters and find no evidence for any Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect,\u000a\u005cDelta y < 7.3 x 10^{-6} (95% CL) averaged over the DMR beam. We examine the\u000atemperature maps near the brightest expected radio sources and detect no\u000aevidence of significant emission. The lack of bright unresolved sources in the\u000aDMR maps, taken with anisotropy measurements on smaller angular scales, places\u000aa weak constraint on the integral number density of any unresolved\u000aPlanck-spectrum sources brighter than flux density S, n(> S) < 2 x 10^4 (S/1\u000aJy)^{-2} sr^{-1}.\u000a

V  A pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson, with a potential of the form $V(\u005cphi) =\u000a\u005cLambda^4[1 \u005cpm \u005ccos(\u005cphi/f)], naturally gives rise to inflation if $f \u005csim\u000aM_{Pl}$ and $\u005cLambda \u005csim M_{GUT}$. We show how this can arise in\u000atechnicolor-like and superstring models, and work out an explicit string\u000aexample in the context of multiple gaugino condensation models. We study the\u000acosmology of this model in detail, and find that sufficient reheating to ensure\u000athat baryogenesis can take place requires $f > 0.3 M_{Pl}$. The primordial\u000adensity fluctuation spectrum generated is a non-scale-invariant power law,\u000a$P(k) \u005cpropto k^{n_s}$, with $n_s \u005csimeq 1 - (M^2_{Pl}/8\u005cpi f^2)$, leading to\u000amore power on large length scales than the $n_s = 1$ Harrison-Zeldovich\u000aspectrum. The standard CDM model with $0 \u005cla n_s \u005cla 0.6-0.7$ could in\u000aprinciple explain the large-scale clustering observed in the APM and IRAS\u000agalaxy surveys as well as large-scale flows, but the COBE microwave anisotropy\u000aimplies such low amplitudes (or high bias factors, $b>2$) for these CDM models\u000athat galaxy formation occurs too late to be viable; combining COBE with\u000asufficiently early galaxy formation or the large-scale flows leads to $n_s\u000a>0.6$, or $f > 0.3 M_{Pl}$ as well. For extended and power law inflation\u000amodels, this constraint is even tighter, $n_s > 0.7$; combined with other\u000abounds on large bubbles in extended inflation, this leaves little room for most\u000aextended models.\u000a

V  We discuss the effects of finite sky coverage and the uncertainty in\u000aextracting information about the power spectrum from experiments on small\u000aangular scales. In general the cosmic variance is enhanced by a factor of\u000a$4\u005cpi/A$, where $A$ is the solid angle sampled by the experiment. As a rough\u000aguide, an experiment with sensitivity peaking at the $\u005cell$th multipole has to\u000acover $\u005csimgt\u005cell$ independent patches to have a lower ``sample variance'' than\u000afor a whole-sky measurement of the quadrupole. Our approach gives a relatively\u000asimple way of attaching an error bar to the theoretical prediction for a\u000aparticular experiment, and thereby comparing theories with experimental\u000aresults, without the need for computationally-intensive Maximum Likelihood or\u000aMonte Carlo calculations.\u000a

V  We present a simple model for slow-rollover inflation where the vacuum energy\u000athat drives inflation is of the order of $G_F^{-2}$; unlike most models, the\u000aconversion of vacuum energy to radiation (``reheating'') is moderately\u000aefficient. The scalar field responsible for inflation is a standard-model\u000asinglet, develops a vacuum expectation value of the order of $4\u005ctimes\u000a10^6\u005cGeV$, has a mass of order $1\u005cGeV$, and can play a role in electroweak\u000aphenomena.\u000a

V  Near--infrared, optical and ultraviolet quasi--simultaneous observations of\u000a11 BL Lacertae objects are reported. For all but one source the dereddened\u000aspectral flux distribution in the $8\u005ccdot10^{13}-2\u005ccdot10^{15}$ Hz frequency\u000arange can be described by a single power law f$_\u005cnu \u005cpropto \u005cnu^{-\u005calpha}$ with\u000aaverage spectral index $<\u005calpha>$ = 0.88 $\u005cpm$ 0.42 (standard deviation) plus,\u000awhere relevant, the contribution of the host galaxy. In most cases the non\u000asimultaneous soft X--ray fluxes obtained by the {\u005cit Einstein Observatory} lie\u000aon or below the extrapolation of the power law. The results are compared with\u000athe average spectral properties of other samples of BL Lacs studied separately\u000ain the IR--optical and in the UV bands. The implications for existing models of\u000athe objects are shortly discussed.\u000a

V  We present the results of spectroscopic observations of 10 nucleated dwarf\u000aelliptical galaxies (dE's) in the Fornax cluster. The blue spectra of Fornax dE\u000agalaxies indicate a wide range of metallicities at a given luminosity, similar\u000ato those of intermediate to \u005cit metal-rich globular clusters. Metal abundances\u000aderived in this paper are well correlated with optical colors and agree with\u000aprevious spectroscopic results. A discrepancy with metallicities inferred from\u000ainfrared colors is evident; possible causes include an intermediate age\u000apopulation and dilution of spectral features by a blue light excess. Dwarf\u000aellipticals exhibit a wide variation of hydrogen line strength which points to\u000aa complex star formation history. Prominent Balmer absorption lines are the\u000asignature of a young stellar population in the nuclei of some (but not all)\u000adE's, while moderately strong Balmer lines in relatively metal-rich dE's are\u000amore consistent with an extended main sequence. The velocity distribution of\u000athe Fornax dwarfs is flatter than that of brighter galaxies at the 75\u005c%\u000aconfidence level, possibly indicating a difference in the kinematics of the two\u000asamples.\u000a

V  In this paper we describe weighting techniques used for the optimal\u000acoaddition of CCD frames with differing characteristics. Optimal means maximum\u000asignal-to-noise (s/n) for stellar objects. We derive formulae for four\u000aapplications: 1) object detection via matched filter, 2) object detection\u000aidentical to DAOFIND, 3) aperture photometry, and 4) ALLSTAR profile-fitting\u000aphotometry. We have included examples involving 21 frames for which either the\u000asky brightness or image resolution varied by a factor of three. The gains in\u000as/n were modest for most of the examples, except for DAOFIND detection with\u000avarying image resolution which exhibited a substantial s/n increase. Even\u000athough the only consideration was maximizing s/n, the image resolution was seen\u000ato improve for most of the variable resolution examples. Also discussed are\u000aempirical fits for the weighting and the availability of the program, WEIGHT,\u000aused to generate the weighting for the individual frames. Finally, we include\u000aappendices describing the effects of clipping algorithms and a scheme for\u000astar/galaxy and cosmic ray/star discrimination.\u000a

V  We study how bubbles grow after the initial nucleation event in generic\u000afirst-order cosmological phase transitions characterised by the values of\u000alatent heat, interface tension and correlation length, and driven by a scalar\u000aorder parameter $\u005cphi$. Equations coupling $\u005cphi$ and the fluid variables $v$\u000aand $T$ and depending on a dissipative constant $\u005cGamma$ are derived and solved\u000anumerically in the 1+1 dimensional case starting from a slightly deformed\u000acritical bubble configuration. Parameters corresponding to QCD and electroweak\u000aphase transitions are chosen and the whole history of the bubble with formation\u000aof combustion and shock fronts is computed as a function of $\u005cGamma$. Both\u000adeflagrations and detonations can appear depending on the values of the\u000aparameters. Reheating due to collisions of bubbles is also computed.\u000a

V  The F0 V star 9 Aur A exhibits an irregular variability of amplitude $\u005capprox\u000a$0.1 magnitude at optical wavelengths. The variations are too slow for it to be\u000aa $\u005cdelta$ Scuti-type star. There is no evidence for a close, interacting\u000acompanion or ring of dust, either from infrared, ultraviolet, or speckle data.\u000aThe photometric variability of 9 Aur A is similar to two other early F dwarf\u000astars: $\u005cgamma$ Doradus and HD 96008. 9 Aur B appears to be an M dwarf, 9 Aur C\u000ais an early- to mid-K dwarf star, and 9 Aur E, if it is a member of the system,\u000aprobably is a normal white dwarf. 9 Aur D is most likely an unrelated and\u000adistant K giant.

V  Using a variety of parameters of local galaxy density, we have examined the\u000aeffects of the environmental density on the presence of bar structures in\u000aspiral galaxies of various morphological types. For an extensive sample of\u000anearby galaxies, listed in the ``Nearby Galaxies Catalogue'' (Tully, 1988a), we\u000ahave found that the spirals characterized by a high local density tend to be\u000abarred if they are early-type and early-type if they are barred (at the\u000asignificance level of $\u005csim$3 sigma), confirming some earlier suggestion of low\u000astatistical significance. This fact, which is observed substantially in\u000alow-luminosity spirals, indicates that galaxy interactions can stimulate the\u000aformation of bars, primarily in early-type, low-luminosity spirals. This is in\u000apartial, qualitative agreement with the most recent relevant N-body\u000asimulations. On the other hand, no significant density segregation is observed\u000abetween pure S-shaped (S(s)) spirals and spirals with inner rings (S(r)), which\u000aare often associated with bars. {\u005cit Subject headings:} galaxies: general ---\u000agalaxies: structure --- galaxies: interactions --- galaxies: clustering\u000a

V  The IV Rencontres de Blois, on Particle Astrophysics, held at the Ch\u005c^ateau\u000ade Blois, June 15-20, 1992, was a meeting well-timed for a reconsideration of\u000athe issues in particle astrophysics in the light of the COBE discovery of the\u000acosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations. This is a summary of what I\u000athought were the most interesting things discussed at Blois: (1) The\u000anear-success of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) in predicting the COBE fluctuation\u000aamplitude, which favors the hypothesis that structure formed in the universe\u000athrough gravitational collapse. (2) The indications that $\u005cOmega\u005capprox1$ and\u000athat the power spectrum has a little more power on supercluster and larger\u000ascales than CDM. These are suggested by the IRAS and CfA redshift surveys and\u000aPOTENT galaxy peculiar velocity analysis, and also by the COBE data. (3) The\u000aconsequent demise of CDM and the rise of hybrid schemes such as Cold+Hot Dark\u000aMatter (C+HDM). (4) The possible implications for neutrino masses and mixings,\u000aand for cosmology, of the recent results on solar neutrinos. (5) The first\u000adiscovery of TeV $\u005cgamma$ rays from an extragalactic source, which was\u000aannounced at Blois. I also summarize here a number of the exciting ongoing and\u000aplanned experiments and observations discussed at Blois: CERN experiments on\u000a$\u005cnu_\u005cmu \u005cnu_\u005ctau$ oscillations, which may be sufficiently sensitive to detect\u000athe $\u005cnu_\u005ctau$ if\u000a

Such a large enhancement could be of import to neutrino-decay models\u000ainvoked in response to the apparent deficit of electron neutrinos observed from\u000athe sun. The significance of this result to such models depends on the specific\u000aform of the neutrino decay, and the particle model within which it is embedded.\u000a

V  According to the Brans--Dicke theory, the value of the gravitational constant\u000aG which we measure at present is determined by the value of the Brans--Dicke\u000ascalar field \u005cphi at the end of inflation. However, due to quantum fluctuations\u000aof the scalar fields produced during inflation, the gravitational constant\u000aG(\u005cphi) may take different values in different exponentially large parts of the\u000aUniverse. We investigate the probability distribution P_p to find a domain of a\u000agiven volume with a given value of the gravitational constant G at a given\u000atime. The investigation is performed for a wide class of effective potentials\u000aof the scalar field \u005csigma which drives inflation, and with two different time\u000aparametrizations. Our work is based on the analytical study of the diffusion\u000aequations for P_p, as well as on the computer simulation of stochastic\u000aprocesses in the inflationary Universe. We have found that in some inflationary\u000amodels the probability distribution P_p rapidly approaches a stationary regime.\u000aThe shape of the distribution depends, however, on the choice of the time\u000aparametrization. In some other models the distribution P_p is not stationary.\u000aAn interpretation of our results and of all ambiguities involved is outlined,\u000aand a possible role of anthropic considerations in determination of the\u000agravitational constant is discussed.\u000a

V  Early photoionization of the intergalactic medium is discussed in a nearly\u000amodel-independent way, in order to investigate whether early structures\u000acorresponding to rare Gaussian peaks in a CDM model can photoionize the\u000aintergalactic medium sufficiently early to appreciably smooth out the microwave\u000abackground fluctuations. We conclude that this is indeed possible for a broad\u000arange of CDM normalizations and is almost inevitable for unbiased CDM, provided\u000athat the bulk of these early structures are quite small, no more massive than\u000aabout 10^8 solar masses. Typical parameter values predict that reionization\u000aoccurs around z=50, thereby suppressing fluctuations on degree scales while\u000aleaving the larger angular scales probed by COBE reasonably unaffected.\u000aHowever, for non-standard CDM, incorporating mixed dark matter, vacuum density\u000aor a tilted primordial power spectrum, early reionization plays no significant\u000arole.\u000a

V  This paper presents and analyses statistical results from a large number of\u000a$N$-body simulations of isolated systems with equal masses, in which $250\u005cle\u000aN\u005cle 2000$. It concentrates on the phase starting around the end of core\u000acollapse, when binaries start to play a crucial role. Interactions of hard\u000abinaries are consistent with the Spitzer (1987) cross section. The evolution of\u000athe half-mass radius after core collapse nearly follows classical theory, The\u000aevolution of the inner parts of the system around the time of core bounce is\u000aconsistent with these simplified models provided that the continuous production\u000aof energy, as usually assumed, is replaced by a model of {\u005csl stochastic}\u000aenergy production. Similarly, post-collapse evolution of the core requires a\u000amodest recalibration of the coefficient of energy generation, especially for\u000asmall $N$. The distributions of velocity dispersion and anisotropy become\u000aremarkably homologous soon after core bounce. The bound mass of the systems\u000avery nearly follows a power law with time. A small number of escapers, presumed\u000ato be those associated with binary activity, dominate the energy which is\u000acarried off. The ``internal" energy of escaping binaries is consistent with\u000atheoretical expectations.\u000a

V  We propose a string-inspired model which correlates several aspects of\u000aparticle physics and cosmology. Inspired by the flat directions and the absence\u000aof adjoint Higgs representations found in typical string models, we consider a\u000ano-scale $SU(5)\u005ctimes U(1)$ supergravity model. This model entails well\u000adetermined low-energy phenomenology, such as the value of the neutralino dark\u000amatter relic abundance and a negative contribution to the vacuum energy. A\u000apositive contribution to the vacuum energy is also typically present in string\u000atheory as a consequence of the running of the fundamental constants towards\u000atheir fixed point values. If these two contributions cancel appropriately, one\u000amay end up with a vacuum energy which brings many cosmological observations\u000ainto better agreement with theoretical expectations. The present abundance of\u000aneutralinos would then be fixed. We delineate the regions of parameter space\u000aallowed in this scenario, and study the ensuing predictions for the sparticle\u000aand Higgs-boson masses in this model.\u000a

V  We study the dynamics of toroidal magnetic flux tubes, symmetric about the\u000arotation axis, inside non-magnetic thick accretion disks around black holes. We\u000apresent model equations which include effects of gravity, centrifugal force,\u000apressure gradient force, Coriolis force, drag, magnetic tension and magnetic\u000abuoyancy. We solve them assuming the disk to be adiabatic. We show that under a\u000awide range of parameters describing the size and the field strength, as well as\u000aangular momentum distribution inside the disk, buoyant flux tubes, either\u000areleased on the equatorial plane or at the outer edge of the disk, can gather\u000ain the chimney-like openings near the axis. This behavior makes the chimneys\u000amagnetically most active and could shed light on the origin and acceleration of\u000acosmic jets, as well as the variabilities observed in Blazars.\u000a

V  The inflationary cosmology is analyzed from the point of view of squeezed\u000aquantum states. As noted by Grishchuk and Sidorov, the amplification of quantum\u000afluctuations into macroscopic perturbations which occurs during cosmic\u000ainflation is a process of quantum squeezing. We carefully develop the squeezed\u000astate formalism and derive the equations that govern the evolution of a\u000agaussian initial state. We derive the power spectrum of density perturbations\u000afor a simple inflationary model and discuss its features. We conclude that the\u000asqueezed state formalism provides an interesting framework within which to\u000astudy the amplification process, but,in disagreement with the claims of\u000aGrishchuk and Sidorov, that it does {\u005cem not} provide us with any new physical\u000aresults.\u000a

V  By using both thermal field theory and a somewhat more intuitive method, we\u000adefine the electric charge as well as the charge radius of neutrinos\u000apropagating inside a plasma. We show that electron neutrinos acquire a charge\u000aradius of order $\u005csim 6.5 \u005ctimes 10^{-16}$ cm, regardless of the properties of\u000athe medium. Then, we compute the rate of plasmon decay which such an electric\u000acharge or a charge radius implies. Taking into account the relativistic effects\u000aof the degenerate electron gas, we compare our results to various\u000aapproximations as well as to recent calculations and determine the regimes\u000awhere the electric charge or the charge radius does mediate the decay of\u000aplasmons. Finally, we discuss the stellar limits on any anomalous charge radius\u000aof neutrinos.\u000a

V  The optical depth to microlensing toward M31 due to known stars in the disk\u000aof M31 itself is $\u005ctau\u005csim 2\u005ctimes 10^{-7}e^{-r/d}$ where $d$ is the disk scale\u000alength and $r$ is the distance along the major axis. Thus, there can be\u000asignificant lensing toward the M31 disk even if M31 contains no dark compact\u000aobjects. The optical depth has a strong dependence on azimuthal angle: at fixed\u000aradius $\u005ctau\u005cpropto[1+ (h/d)\u005ctan i\u005ccos\u005cphi]^{-2}$ where $h$ is the scale height\u000aof the disk, $i=75^\u005ccirc$ is the inclination of M31, and $\u005cphi$ is the\u000aazimuthal angle relative to the near minor axis. By measuring the optical depth\u000aas a function of radial and azimuthal position, it is possible to estimate $h$\u000aand $d$ for the mass of the M31 disk, and so determine whether the disk light\u000atraces disk mass. Ground-based observations in $0.\u005chskip-2pt''5$ seeing of 0.8\u000a$\u005crm deg^2$ once per week could yield $\u005csim 3$ events per year. With an\u000aambitious space-based project, it would be possible to to observe $\u005csim 80$\u000aevents per year. If lensing events were dominated by the M31 spheroid rather\u000athan the disk, the event rate would be higher and the spheroid's parameters\u000acould be measured. The pattern of optical depths differs substantially for a\u000adisk and a spheroid.\u000a

V  We describe an algorithm for long-term planetary orbit integrations,\u000aincluding the dominant post-Newtonian effects, that employs individual\u000atimesteps for each planet. The algorithm is symplectic and exhibits short-term\u000aerrors that are $O(\u005cepsilon\u005cOmega^2\u005ctau^2)$ where $\u005ctau$ is the timestep,\u000a$\u005cOmega$ is a typical orbital frequency, and $\u005cepsilon\u005cll1$ is a typical\u000aplanetary mass in solar units. By a special starting procedure long-term errors\u000aover an integration interval $T$ can be reduced to\u000a$O(\u005cepsilon^2\u005cOmega^3\u005ctau^2T)$. A sample 0.8 Myr integration of the nine\u000aplanets illustrates that Pluto can have a timestep more than 100 times\u000aMercury's, without dominating the positional error. Our algorithm is applicable\u000ato other $N$-body systems.\u000a

Quantum fields acquire mass as\u000aa consequence of nonperturbative interactions with those particles condensed in\u000athe zero-momentum state (which constitutes the physical vacuum of the theory)\u000agiving rise in turn to the appearance of density fluctuations.

V  The edge-on galaxy NGC 4565 has been observed in the 12CO(J=1-0)-line\u000aemission using the Nobeyama 45-m telescope with an angular resolution of 15".\u000aWe obtained a scan along the major axis for +/-5' (+/- 15 kpc) about the\u000agalactic center, and some scans perpendicular to the galactic plane. The radial\u000adensity distribution shows a dense molecular gas ring of 5 kpc radius, which is\u000aassociated with an HI ring. The molecular disk comprises two components: an\u000aunresolved thin and dense disk, and a thick disk (or a halo) extending to a\u000aheight greater than 1.4 kpc. The position-velocity diagram shows that the\u000ageneral rotation of the entire galaxy is circular with a flat rotation curve.\u000aHowever, the radial distribution of molecular gas is asymmetric with respect to\u000athe galaxy center in the sense that the molecular gas is much richer in the NW\u000aside. We derived a radial variation of \u005chtwo-to-(HI+ \u005chtwo) density ratio, and\u000afound that int erstellar gas in the central 4 kpc region is almost entirely H2,\u000awhile HI is dominant beyond 10 kpc.

This best fit to the fluxes contradicts explicit nonstandard solar\u000amodels, which generally reduce the $^8$B flux more than the $^7$Be. Those\u000amodels are well parameterized by a single parameter, the central temperature.\u000a

V  Highly dynamic magnetospheric perturbations in neutron star environments can\u000anaturally account for the features observed in Gamma-ray Burst spectra. The\u000asource distribution, however, appears to be extragalactic. Although\u000anoncatastrophic isotropic emission mechanisms may be ruled out on energetic and\u000atiming arguments, MHD processes can produce strongly anisotropic gamma-rays\u000awith an observable flux out to distances of around 1-2 Gpc. Here we show that\u000asheared Alfven waves propagating along open magnetospheric field lines at the\u000apoles of magnetized neutron stars transfer their energy dissipationally to the\u000acurrent sustaining the field misalignment and thereby focus their power into a\u000aspatial region around 1000 times smaller than that of the crustal disturbance.\u000aThis produces a strong (observable) flux enhancement along certain directions.\u000aWe apply this model to a source population of ``turned-off'' pulsars that have\u000anonetheless retained their strong magnetic fields and have achieved alignment\u000aat a period of greater than 5 seconds.\u000a

For $n < 0.87$, gravity waves perturb the CMBR by a\u000alarger amount than density perturbations, whereas for $n > 0.87$ the reverse is\u000atrue. %For nearly exponential inflation, on the other hand, the contribution to\u000athe %microwave anisotropy from scalar density perturbations always exceeds\u000a%that due to gravity waves. Normalising the amplitude of the density\u000aperturbation spectrum at large scales, using the observed value of the COBE\u000aquadrupole, we determine $(\u005cdelta M /M)_{16}$ -- the rms density contrast on\u000ascales $\u005csim 16 h_{50}^{-1}$ Mpc, for cosmological models with cold dark\u000amatter. We find that for $n < 0.75$, a large amount of biasing is required in\u000aorder to reconcile theory with observations.\u000a

V  Long slit spectra of the region around the Luminous Blue Variable AG Car\u000aobtained in June 1990, just before the onset of its new brightening phase,\u000aindicate that AG Car was in the hottest phase so far recorded. The spectrum\u000ashows strong broad emissions of He II 468.6 nm, and [Fe III] 465.8-470.1 nm,\u000aand He I, N II, Si III, Al III and Fe III with a P Cygni profile. We have also\u000aidentified weak lines of C II and O II. A faint continuum emission has been\u000adetected within the whole ring nebula. We also find that the spectrum of some\u000aregions is partially due to scattered star's light. This provides evidence of\u000athe presence of dust grains, and indicates that even in present times dust is\u000acondensing from AG Car wind. The sharp outer edge of the ring suggest the\u000apresence of a shock front. We have also identified an extended low density H II\u000a$halo$, which should be associated with the residual of the stellar wind of a\u000aprevious cooler evolutionary phase of AG Car. In the halo the H$\u005calpha$/[N II]\u000aratio is strengthened with respect to the ring nebula, possibly because of a\u000adiscontinuity in the N abundance. We suggest that part of the star's reddening\u000aoriginates in the ring nebula and diffuse halo, which could alter the present\u000aestimates of the star's distance. The extracted spectrograms are available as\u000acomputer files on request to rossi@astrom.astro.it. Article in press in A\u005c&A.\u000a

V  Condensed Abstract: We present an extensive study of the inception of\u000asupernova explosions by following the evolution of the cores of two massive\u000astars (15 Msun and 25 Msun) in two dimensions. Our calculations begin at the\u000aonset of core collapse and stop several 100 ms after the bounce, at which time\u000asuccessful explosions of the appropriate magnitude have been obtained. (...)\u000aGuided by our numerical results, we have developed a paradigm for the supernova\u000aexplosion mechanism. We view a supernova as an open cycle thermodynamic engine\u000ain which a reservoir of low-entropy matter (the envelope) is thermally coupled\u000aand physically connected to a hot bath (the protoneutron star) by a neutrino\u000aflux, and by hydrodynamic instabilities. (...) In essence, a Carnot cycle is\u000aestablished in which convection allows out-of-equilibrium heat transfer\u000amediated by neutrinos to drive low entropy matter to higher entropy and\u000atherefore extracts mechanical energy from the heat generated by gravitational\u000acollapse. We argue that supernova explosions are nearly guaranteed and\u000aself-regulated by the high efficiency of the thermodynamic engine. (...)\u000aConvection continues to accumulate energy exterior to the neutron star until a\u000asuccessful explosion has occurred. At this time, the envelope is expelled and\u000atherefore uncoupled from the heat source (the neutron star) and the energy\u000ainput ceases. This paradigm does not invoke new or modified physics over\u000aprevious treatments, but relies on compellingly straightforward thermodynamic\u000aarguments. It provides a robust and self-regulated explosion mechanism to power\u000asupernovae which is effective under a wide range of physical parameters.\u000a

V  The distributions of peculiar velocities of rich clusters and of groups of\u000agalaxies are investigated for different cosmological models and are compared\u000awith observations. Four cosmological models are studied: standard ($\u005cOmega=1$)\u000aCDM, low-density CDM, HDM ($\u005cOmega=1$), and PBI. We find that rich clusters of\u000agalaxies exhibit a Maxwellian distribution of peculiar velocities in all\u000amodels, as expected from a Gaussian initial density fluctuation field. The\u000acluster 3-D velocity distribution is generally similar in the models: it peaks\u000aat $v \u005csim 500$ km s$^{-1}$, and extends to high cluster velocities of $v \u005csim\u000a1500$ km s$^{-1}$. Approximately 10\u005c% of all model rich clusters move with high\u000apeculiar velocities of $v \u005cge 10^3$ km s$^{-1}$. The highest velocity clusters\u000afrequently originate in dense superclusters. The group velocity distribution\u000ais, in general, similar to the velocity distribution of the rich clusters. In\u000aall but the low-density CDM model, the mass exhibits a longer tail of high\u000avelocities than do the clusters. This high-velocity tail originates mostly from\u000athe high velocities that exist within rich clusters. The model velocity\u000adistributions of groups and clusters of galaxies are compared with\u000aobservations. The data are generally consistent with the models, but exhibit a\u000asomewhat larger high-velocity tail, to $v_r \u005csim 3000$ km s$^{-1}$. While this\u000ahigh-velocity tail is similar to the HDM model predictions, the data are\u000aconsistent with the other models studied, including the low-density CDM model,\u000awhich best fits most other large-scale structure observations.

It predicts significant shock heating by slowly varying\u000aperturbations previously thought to be negligible according to the adiabatic\u000acriterion.

V  We analyze the temperature three--point correlation function and the skewness\u000aof the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), providing general relations in terms\u000aof multipole coefficients. We then focus on applications to large angular scale\u000aanisotropies, such as those measured by the {\u005cem COBE} DMR, calculating the\u000acontribution to these quantities from primordial, inflation generated, scalar\u000aperturbations, via the Sachs--Wolfe effect. Using the techniques of stochastic\u000ainflation we are able to provide a {\u005cit universal} expression for the ensemble\u000aaveraged three--point function and for the corresponding skewness, which\u000aaccounts for all primordial second--order effects. These general expressions\u000awould moreover apply to any situation where the bispectrum of the primordial\u000agravitational potential has a {\u005cem hierarchical} form. Our results are then\u000aspecialized to a number of relevant models: power--law inflation driven by an\u000aexponential potential, chaotic inflation with a quartic and quadratic potential\u000aand a particular case of hybrid inflation. In all these cases non--Gaussian\u000aeffects are small: as an example, the {\u005cem mean} skewness is much smaller than\u000athe cosmic {\u005cem rms} skewness implied by a Gaussian temperature fluctuation\u000afield.\u000a

V  Recently Lu presented tentative evidence for C IV lines in QSO Lyman-alpha\u000aforest systems with strong lines. We have performed a similar search for C IV\u000ain our 10 km/sec echelle spectra of the bright QSO HS~1946+7658. We shifted the\u000aspectra to align the expected positions of the C IV lines in 65 Lyman-alpha\u000asystems, then added them. The resulting composite spectrum, equivalent to 390\u000ahours of exposure time on the Lick 3-m telescope, has a signal-to-noise ratio\u000aof 80 per 0.025 Angstrom in the rest frame of the absorbers. We do not see any\u000aC IV lines down to a $2\u005csigma$ limit of W$(1548) \u005cleq 1.4 $~m\u005cAA, about\u000aone-fifth of the strength of the lines seen by Lu. The C IV lines which Lu saw\u000amust be restricted to rare Lyman-alpha systems with large H I column densities\u000a$\u005cgeq 10^{14}$~cm$^{-2}$, which are too rare to show C IV in our sample. More\u000acommon Lyman-alpha systems with H I column densities of $10^{13}$ --\u000a$10^{14}$~cm$^{-2}$ do not show C IV lines. If their ionization is H/H~I $=\u000a10^4$ then they have [C/H] $\u005cleq -2.0$.\u000a

V  We present numerical simulations of galaxy formation, one of the most\u000achallenging problems in computational astrophysics. The key point in such\u000asimulations is the efficient solution of the N--body problem. If the gas of a\u000agalaxy is treated by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), the\u000ahydrodynamic equations can be reduced to a form similar to that of the N--body\u000aproblem. A straightforward implementation requires a computational effort\u000a$\u005cpropto N^2$, making it prohibitively expensive to simulate systems larger\u000athan $10^5$ particles even on the largest available supercomputers. After a\u000adescription of the physical and numerical problems, we shortly review the\u000astandard numerical methods to tackle these problems and discuss their\u000aadvantages and drawbacks. We also present a completely different approach to\u000aperform such simulations using a workstation in combination with the special\u000apurpose hardware {\u005csc Grape}. After a discussion of the main features of {\u005csc\u000aGrape}, we present a simple implementation of a {\u005csc SPH}--N--body code on such\u000aa configuration. Comparing results and performance of these two approaches, we\u000ashow, that with an investment of US \u005c$ 50000, the problem can be solved up to 5\u000atimes faster than on a {\u005csc Cray} YMP.\u000a

V  The evolution of a universe with Brans-Dicke gravity and nonzero curvature is\u000ainvestigated here. We present the equations of motion and their solutions\u000aduring the radiation dominated era. In a Friedman-Robertson-Walker cosmology we\u000ashow explicitly that the three possible values of curvature $\u005ckappa=+1,0,-1$\u000adivide the evolution of the Brans-Dicke universe into dynamically distinct\u000aclasses just as for the standard model. Subsequently we discuss the flatness\u000aproblem which exists in Brans-Dicke gravity as it does in the standard model.\u000aIn addition, we demonstrate a flatness problem in MAD Brans-Dicke gravity. In\u000ageneral, in any model that addresses the horizon problem, including inflation,\u000athere are two components to the flatness issue: i) at the Planck epoch\u000acurvature gains importance, and ii) during accelerated expansion curvature\u000abecomes less important and the universe flattens. In many cases the universe\u000amust be very flat at the Planck scale in order for the accelerated epoch to be\u000areached, thus there can be a residual flatness problem.\u000a

V  In this paper we develop some combinatorial models for continuous spaces. In\u000athis spirit we study the approximations of continuous spaces by graphs,\u000amolecular spaces and coordinate matrices. We define the dimension on a discrete\u000aspace by means of axioms, and the axioms are based on an obvious geometrical\u000abackground. This work presents some discrete models of n-dimensional Euclidean\u000aspaces, n-dimensional spheres, a torus and a projective plane. It explains how\u000ato construct new discrete spaces and describes in this connection several\u000athree-dimensional closed surfaces with some topological singularities\u000a  It also analyzes the topology of (3+1)-spacetime. We are also discussing the\u000aquestion by R. Sorkin [19] about how to derive the system of simplicial\u000acomplexes from a system of open covering of a topological space S.\u000a

V  We present new ground-based data following up on the HST discovery of\u000alow-redshift Lya absorption in the sight-line to the quasar 3C273. Narrow-band\u000afilter observations show that there are no H II regions within a 12 kpc radius\u000aof the line-of-sight to the quasar, at the velocities of three of the\u000aabsorbers. Broad-band imaging shows that there are no dwarf galaxies at Virgo\u000adistances with absolute magnitude above MB~-13.5 and within a radius of 40 kpc.\u000aWe present fiber spectroscopy of galaxies within a radius of 1 deg, down to an\u000aapparent magnitude of B~19. We show that the absorbers are definitely not\u000adistributed at random with respect to the galaxies, but also that the\u000aabsorber-galaxy correlation function is not as strong as the galaxy-galaxy\u000acorrelation function on large scales. Our data are consistent with the\u000ahypothesis that all galaxies more luminous than 1/10 L* have effective\u000across-sections (for association with absorbers with Log(NH)>13.0), of between\u000a0.5 and 1 Mpc. We also show a clear case of a Lya absorber which has no galaxy\u000abrighter than MB=-18 within a projected distance of 4.8 Mpc, and discuss the\u000apossibility that Lya absorbers are destroyed in a rich galaxy environment.\u000a

The high concentration\u000aof bulge-rich galaxies in the cores of clusters of galaxies can be accounted\u000afor by several popular physical processes: 1) biased early elliptical\u000aformation, 2) abortion of disk formation by tidal destruction of the gas\u000areservoirs that fuel such disks, 3) ram pressure stripping of the gas in disks\u000aby intergalactic gas, 4) merging of spiral galaxies into ellipticals (which is\u000athe main focus of this review).

V  By image processing and color excess analyses of B, V, R, and I-band CCD\u000aimages of the central region of M31 taken with the Kiso 105-cm Schmidt\u000atelescope, we found a bar of 200 pc length. We also found a more extended\u000a``face-on" spiral feature of dark clouds, which appear t o be connected to this\u000abar and is probably an out-of-plane structure. The \u005cco-line emission was\u000adetected from the dark clouds using the Nobeyama 45m telescope, and the virial\u000amass of individual clouds was estimated to be about 10E6 solar masses. The CO\u000aintensity-to-virial mass ratio is anomalously small, and so is the color\u000aexcess-to-mass ratio, which indicates a low temperature and a small amount dust\u000aper unit gas mass in the cloud, respectively. This implies that the molecular\u000aclouds in the central few hundred pc of M31 are more primeval, suggesting a low\u000astar-formation and low dust supply. We propose a possible scenario for the\u000aorigin of the face-on spiral containing such gas on the basis of a ram-pressure\u000aaccretion model of stripped gas clouds from the companion galaxies. Key words:\u000aDark clouds -- CO line -- Galaxies; individual (M31) -- Interstellar dust --\u000aNuclei of galaxies.\u000a

V  The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) fluctuations at very small angular\u000ascales (less than $10'$) induced by matter sources are computed in a simplified\u000away. The result corrects a previous formula appearing in the literature. The\u000asmall scale power spectrum from cosmic strings is then calculated by a new\u000aanalytic method. The result compares extremely well with the spectrum computed\u000aby numerical techniques (when the old, incorrect, formula is used). The upper\u000abound on the string parameters derived from OVRO data is re-examined, taking\u000ainto account the non-Gaussian nature of stringy perturbations on small scales.\u000aAssuming a conventional ionization history, the bound is $\u005cgamma G\u005cmu <\u000a11\u005ctimes 10^{-6}$, where $\u005cgamma^2$ is the number of horizon lengths of string\u000aper horizon volume.

V  We consider the implications of the recent results of SAGE and GALLEX\u000aexperiments for the solution of the solar neutrino problem in the framework of\u000athe resonant neutrino spin-flavor precession scenario. It is shown that this\u000ascenario is consistent with all the existing solar neutrino data including the\u000agallium results. The quality of the fit of the data depends crucially on the\u000amagnetic field profile used which makes it possible to get information about\u000athe magnetic field in the solar interior. In particular, the magnetic field in\u000athe core of the sun must not be too strong ($<3 \u005ctimes 10^6$ G). The detection\u000arate in the gallium detectors turns out to be especially sensitive to the\u000amagnitude of $\u005cDelta m^2$. Predictions for forthcoming solar-neutrino\u000aexperiments are made.\u000a

We\u000aassume a curl--free velocity field, although in the formulation presented here\u000athis assumption can be dropped. Toy models with special symmetry are used to\u000atest the intrinsic accuracy of the method compared to linear theory.\u000a  Finding significant improvement we then test the method in more detail on\u000aN--body simulations, considering the problems associated with sampling the\u000adensity field using sparse, magnitude--limited galaxy redshift surveys.\u000a  A method of estimating the magnitude of shot--noise effects on the\u000adeprojected velocity field is derived.\u000a  We find there is a good correlation between the true and deprojected density\u000aand velocity fields, even in the mildly nonlinear regime, provided that on\u000alarge scales galaxies trace the mass.

V  We propose a method for deriving a dynamical lower bound on $\u005cOmega$ from\u000adiverging flows in low-density regions, based on the fact that large outflows\u000aare not expected in a low-$\u005cOmega$ universe. The velocities are assumed to be\u000ainduced by gravity from small initial fluctuations, but no assumptions are made\u000aregarding their exact Gaussian nature, galaxy biasing, or $\u005cLambda$. The\u000aderivatives of a diverging velocity field infer a nonlinear approximation to\u000athe mass density, which is an overestimate when the true value of $\u005cOmega$ is\u000aassumed. This inferred density can become ridiculously negative when the\u000aassumed $\u005cOmega$ is too low, thus bounding $\u005cOmega$. Observed radial peculiar\u000avelocities of galaxies allow the \u005cpot\u005c procedure to recover the required\u000avelocity field, Gaussian smoothed at $1200\u005ckms$. The density and the associated\u000aerrors are then inferred for different values of $\u005cOmega$, searching for a void\u000awhich shows negative inferred density with high confidence. A preliminary\u000aapplication to data in a southern void indicates that $\u005cOmega\u005cleq 0.3$ can be\u000aruled out at the $2.4$-sigma level. A detailed study of possible systematic\u000aerrors is under way.\u000a

V  In the field of planet and proto-planetary disk detection, achieving high\u000aangular resolution and high dynamic range is a necessity. Coronography coupled\u000awith adaptive optics on Hubble Space Telescope is a way to get both good\u000aspatial resolution and high dynamic range. However, because of the residual\u000afigure errors on the primary and on the secondary, HST has a scattered light\u000alevel that prevents it from detecting extra-solar planets. Our simulations show\u000athat by using an active mirror (400-1000 actuators) in the optical path of HST\u000awith adaptive optics, we can correct the mirror errors and decrease the\u000ascattering level by a factor $10^{2}$ (from $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-6}$ fainter than\u000athe star). Furthermore, by controlling the spatial frequencies of the active\u000amirror with a {\u005cem dark hole\u005c/} algorithm we can decrease the scattering level\u000ain image zones where planet detection is likely. Using this technique, we have\u000asucceeded in decreasing the scattering level to $3\u005ctimes 10^{-8}$ of the star\u000aintensity within 1 arcsec from the central star. This will allow the detection\u000aof a Jupiter-like planet $10^{-9}$ times dimmer than the central star located\u000a10 pc away in 1 hour of integration time with a signal-to-noise ratio of 5.\u000aThis paper describes the method used to determine the actuator strokes applied\u000ato a deformable mirror to achieve planet detection and the design of a\u000acoronograph which implements this novel technique.\u000a

V  The fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation may contain\u000adeviations from gaussian statistics which would be reflected in a nonzero value\u000aof three-point correlation function of $\u005cDelta T$. However, any potential\u000aobservation of the three-point function is limited by cosmic variance, even if\u000aa whole-sky map of $\u005cDelta T$ is available. Here I derive a general formula for\u000athe cosmic variance of the three-point function in terms of integrals over the\u000atwo-point function. This formula can be applied to any cosmological model and\u000ato any experimental measurement strategy. It gives a fundamental lower limit on\u000athe magnitude of a measurable three-point correlation function, and hence on\u000athe measurable amount of skewness in the distribution of $\u005cDelta T$.\u000a

V  Recent maser surveys have shown that many potential OH/IR stars have no OH\u000amasers in their circumstellar envelopes, despite the modest requirements which\u000ashould be implicitly met by IRAS colour-selected candidates. It has been\u000asuggested that these OH/IR colour mimics must have a degenerate companion which\u000adissociates OH molecules and disrupts the masing action, ie. that they are\u000arelated to symbiotic Miras. Coincidentally, there is a paucity of long-period\u000asymbiotic Miras and symbiotic OH/IR stars. Phenomonologically, those that are\u000aknown seem to cluster in the zone where field Miras transform into OH/IR stars.\u000aIf it could be proven that OH/IR colour mimics contain a degenerate star, that\u000aobservable evidence of this star is hidden from view by CS dust whilst it\u000aslowly accretes from the wind of its Mira companion, then we have an excellent\u000aexplanation for not only the existence of OH/IR colour mimics, but also for the\u000alow observed frequency of symbiotic OH/IR stars and the common occurrence of\u000avery slow novae in long-period symbiotic Miras. Here, we employ radio continuum\u000aradiation (which should escape unhindered from within the dust shells) as a\u000asimple probe of the postulated hot degenerate companions which would inevitably\u000aionize a region of their surrounding gas. We compare the radio and infrared\u000aproperties of the colour mimics with those of normal symbiotic Miras, using the\u000astrong correlation between radio and mid-IR emission in symbiotic stars. We\u000ashow that if a hot companion exists then, unlike their symbiotic counterparts,\u000athey must produce radiation-bounded nebulae. Our observations provide no\u000asupport for the above scenario for the lack of observed masers, but neither do\u000athey permit a rejection of this scenario.\u000a

V  The cold dark matter (CDM) scenario for structure formation in the Universe\u000ais very attractive and has many successes; however, when its spectrum of\u000adensity perturbations is normalized to the COBE anisotropy measurement the\u000alevel of inhomogeneity predicted on small scales is too large. This can be\u000aremedied by a tau neutrino of mass $1\u005cMeV - 10\u005cMeV$ and lifetime $0.1\u005csec -\u000a100\u005csec$ whose decay products include electron neutrinos because it allows the\u000atotal energy density in relativistic particles to be doubled without\u000ainterfering with nucleosynthesis. The anisotropies predicted on the degree\u000ascale for ``$\u005ctau$CDM'' are larger than standard CDM. Experiments at $e^\u005cpm$\u000acolliders may be able to probe such a mass range.\u000a

V  We present images of the peculiar galaxy Arp~10 which reveal two rings of\u000aconcurrent star formation. Apart from a bright ring visible on early\u000aphotographs of the system, an even brighter inner ring of \u005cion{H}{2} regions is\u000afound within the nuclear bulge of the galaxy. A very faint ring-arc of\u000a\u005cion{H}{2} regions is also seen associated with a third outer ring or shell. An\u000ainvestigation of the H$\u005calpha$ fluxes in the rings reveals an increase in the\u000aemission where the ring surface density in the R-band light exceeds\u000a21.3$\u005cpm$0.2 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. If the R-band light is dominated by old stars\u000ain the underlying density wave, then the results suggest evidence for a Star\u000aFormation law which exhibits a threshold dependence on the strength of the\u000adensity wave in the rings. Even if the R-band continuum in the ring is heavily\u000acontaminated with red light from the underlying young stars then a smaller, but\u000astill significant non-linear enhancement in the star formation rates (SFR) in\u000aone segment of the second ring is required to explain the results. In either\u000acase, strong trends in the SFR with azimuth around Ring~2 are in good agreement\u000awith off-center collisional ring galaxy models.\u000a

V  We present the initial results of a study of globular clusters in M31, using\u000athe Faint Object Camera (FOC) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The sample\u000aof objects consists of 13 clusters spanning a range of properties. Three inde-\u000apendent image deconvolution techniques were used in order to compensate for the\u000aoptical problems of the HST, leading to mutually fully consistent results. We\u000apresent detailed tests and comparisons to determine the reliability and limits\u000aof these deconvolution methods, and conclude that high-quality surface photome-\u000atry of M31 globulars is possible with the HST data. Surface brightness profiles\u000ahave been extracted, and core radii, half-light radii, and central surface\u000abrightness values have been measured for all of the clusters in the sample.\u000aTheir comparison with the values derived from ground-based observations indi-\u000acates the later to be systematically and strongly biased by the seeing effects,\u000aas it may be expected. A comparison of the structural parameters with those of\u000athe Galactic globulars shows that the structural properties of the M31 globu-\u000alars are very similar to those of their Galactic counterparts. A candidate for\u000aa post-core-collapse cluster, Bo 343 = G 105, has been already identified from\u000athese data; this is the first such detection in the M31 g. c. system.\u000a

V  In a recent paper, we suggested that the density fluctuation spectra arising\u000afrom power-law (or extended) inflation, which are tilted with respect to the\u000aHarrison--Zel'dovich spectrum, may provide an explanation for the excess large\u000ascale clustering seen in galaxy surveys such as the APM survey. In the light of\u000athe new results from COBE, we examine in detail here cold dark matter\u000acosmogonies based on inflationary models predicting power-law spectra. Along\u000awith power-law and extended inflation, this class includes natural inflation.\u000aThe latter is of interest because, unlike the first two, it produces a\u000apower-law spectrum without significant gravitational wave production. We\u000aexamine a range of phenomena, including large angle microwave background\u000afluctuations, clustering in the galaxy distribution, bulk peculiar velocity\u000aflows, the formation of high redshift quasars and the epoch of structure\u000aformation. Of the three models, only natural inflation seems capable of\u000aexplaining the large scale clustering of optical galaxies. Such a model, though\u000aat best marginal even at present, has some advantages over standard CDM and on\u000amost grounds appears to perform at least as well. Power-law inflation's primary\u000ainterest may ultimately only be in permitting a larger bias parameter than\u000astandard CDM; it appears unable to explain excess clustering. Most models of\u000aextended inflation are ruled out at a high confidence level.\u000a

V  Using an analytic model we show that the predictions of the cosmic string\u000amodel for the peculiar velocities and the microwave background (MBR) anisotropy\u000adepend on similar combinations of string evolution parameters. Normalizing from\u000athe COBE detection of MBR anisotropy, and for certain reasonable values of\u000astring network evolution parameters, we find that the magnitude of predicted\u000avelocity flows is in good agreement with observations on small scales but is\u000ainconsistent with observations on large scales ($ > 50 h^{-1}$Mpc). The Cosmic\u000aMach Number obtained from the cosmic string scenario is found to depend on a\u000asingle network evolution parameter and is consistent with observations on\u000ascales $5h^{-1}$Mpc to $20h^{-1}$Mpc.\u000a

V  The position angles of a large number of Abell and Shectman clusters (in\u000atotal 637 clusters), identified in the Lick map as surface density\u000aenhancements, are estimated. Using published redshifts for 277 of these I have\u000adetected strong nearest neighbour alignments (2.5 - 3 sigma level), up to about\u000a15 Mpc (Ho = 100). Weaker alignments but still significant are found up to\u000alarger separations. An even more significant alignment (4 sigma) is found\u000abetween all neighbours residing in superclusters and having separations <= 10\u000aMpc. Again weaker but significant alignments are found when larger separations\u000aare considered. I have performed various tests to check whether systematic\u000aeffects could induce an artificial alignment signal but I find no evidence for\u000athe presence of such effects. Since my cluster sample is neither volume limited\u000anor redshift complete, a fact that would tend to wash-out any real alignment\u000asignal, the alignments detected should reflect a real and possibly a stronger\u000aunderline effect.\u000a

V  We study the formation of structure for a universe that undergoes a recent\u000aloitering phase. We compare the nonlinear mass distribution to that in a\u000astandard, matter dominated cosmology. The statistical aspects of the clustered\u000amatter are found to be robust to changes in the expansion law, an exception\u000abeing that the peculiar velocities are lower by a factor of $\u005csim 3$ in the\u000aloitering model. Further, in the loitering scenario, nonlinear growth of\u000aperturbation occurs more recently ($z\u005csim 3-5$) than in the matter dominated\u000acase. Differences in the high redshift appearances of the two models will\u000aresult but observable consequences depend critically on the chosen form, onset\u000aand duration of the loitering phase.\u000a

V  In this paper we show that the conventional diffusive shock acceleration\u000amechanism for cosmic rays associated with relativistic astrophysical shocks in\u000aactive galactic nuclei (AGNs) has severe difficulties to explain the highest\u000aenergy cosmic ray events. We show that protons above around $2\u005ctimes10^{20}\u005ceV$\u000acould have marginally been produced by this mechanism in an AGN or a rich\u000agalaxy cluster not further away than around $100\u005cMpc$. However, for the highest\u000aenergy Fly's Eye and Yakutsk events this is inconsistent with the observed\u000aarrival directions. Galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields appear unable to\u000aalter the direction of such energetic particles by more than a few degrees. We\u000aalso discuss some other options for these events associated with relativistic\u000aparticles including pulsar acceleration of high $Z$ nuclei. At the present\u000astage of knowledge the concept of topological defects left over from the early\u000auniverse as the source for such events appears to be a promising option. Such\u000asources are discussed and possible tests of this hypothesis are proposed.\u000a

V  Using a simple analytic model based on seed superposition we obtain the\u000aspectrum of microwave background perturbations induced by cosmic strings on all\u000aangular scales larger than about 2 armin. We assume standard recombination in\u000aan Einstein de Sitter universe with $h=1/2$ and study the fluctuation spectrum\u000aalong a great circle in the sky.\u000a  Doppler and potential perturbations on the last scattering surface\u000a(Sachs-Wolfe effect) are shown to dominate over post-recombination\u000aperturbations on scales smaller than about 2 degrees. Using a filter function\u000acorresponding to the COBE experiment we obtain an effective power spectrum\u000aindex $n_{eff}\u005csimeq 1.35$ in good agreement with the recently announced second\u000ayear COBE data showing $n_{eff}\u005csimeq 1.5$. The only free parameter ($G\u005cmu$) of\u000athe string model is fixed by normalizing on the COBE detection leading to\u000a$G\u005cmu=1.6$. Other parameters (e.g. the {\u005cit rms} string velocity) are fixed by\u000acomparing with string simulations. Using these parameter values we compare the\u000a{\u005cit rms} temperature fluctuations $({{\u005cDelta T}\u005cover T})_{\u005cit rms}$ predicted\u000afor ongoing experiments (Tenerife, SP91, MAX, OVRO etc) with detections and\u000awith the corresponding predictions of inflationary models.\u000a

V  The effect of the magnetic skew on the Parker instability is investigated by\u000ameans of the linear stability analysis for a gravitationally stratified gas\u000alayer permeated by a horizontal magnetic field. When the magnetic field is\u000askewed (i.e., the field line direction is a function of the height), the\u000awavelength of the most unstable mode is $ \u005clambda \u005c; \u005csim \u005c; 10 H $ where $ H $\u000ais the pressure scale height. The growth rate of the short wavelength modes is\u000agreatly reduced when the gradient in the magnetic field direction exceeds 0.5\u000aradian per scale height. Our results indicate that the Parker instability in a\u000askewed magnetic field preferentially forms large scale structures like giant\u000amolecular clouds.\u000a

V  We investigate the evolution of interfaces among phases of the interstellar\u000amedium with different temperature. It is found that, for some initial\u000aconditions, the dynamical effects related to conductive fronts are very\u000aimportant even if radiation losses, which tend to decelerate the front\u000apropagation, are taken into account. We have also explored the consequences of\u000athe inclusion of shear and bulk viscosity, and we have allowed for saturation\u000aof the kinetic effects. Numerical simulations of a cloud immersed in a hot\u000amedium have been performed; depending on the ratio of conductive to dynamical\u000atime, the density is increased by a huge factor and the cloud may become\u000aoptically thick. Clouds that are highly compressed are able to stop the\u000aevaporation process even if their initial size is smaller than the Field\u000alength. In addition to the numerical approach, the time dependent evolution has\u000abeen studied also analytically. Simple techniques have been applied to the\u000aproblem in order to study the transition stages to a stationary state. The\u000aglobal properties of the solution for static and steady fronts and useful\u000arelations among the various physical variables are derived; a mechanical\u000aanalogy is often used to clarify the physics of the results. It is demonstrated\u000athat a class of soliton-like solutions are admitted by the hydrodynamical\u000aequations appropriate to describe the conduction/cooling fronts (in the\u000ainviscid case) that do not require a heat flux at the boundaries. Some\u000aastrophysical consequences are indicated along with some possible applications\u000ato the structure of the Galactic ISM and to extragalactic objects.\u000a

V  We examine the constraints on theories of galaxy formation that are obtained\u000afrom observations of damped $\u005clya$ (DL) systems, assuming they are gaseous\u000aprotodisks in dark matter halos. Using the Press-Schechter formalism, we find\u000athat the mixed dark matter model, with $\u005cohdm = 0.3$, $\u005cocdm = 0.65$, $\u005cobaryon\u000a= 0.05$, and $h=0.5$, is ruled out because the number of galactic halos at\u000a$z\u005csimeq 3$ is too small to account for the total gaseous mass in DL systems,\u000aeven under the assumption that all the gas in collapsed halos has settled into\u000adisks of neutral gas. The standard CDM model can account for the gas in DL\u000asystems if the bias is $b\u005clsim 2$; the same is true for the CDM model with a\u000acosmological constant, if $b\u005clsim 1.5$ for $\u005cLambda = 0.8$. However, one still\u000aneeds to assume that a fraction $\u005cgsim 0.4$ of the baryons in collapsed halos\u000aat $z\u005csimeq 3$ is in the form of neutral gas in disks. We also calculate the\u000acolumn density distribution $f(\u005cnhi)$ of the DL systems, in terms of the\u000asurface density profiles of disks and the distribution of their central column\u000adensities. It is shown that the form of $f(\u005cnhi)$ at the high end of column\u000adensity is a diagnostic for the nature of DL systems.\u000a

V  The unusually large eccentricity ($e_1=0.025$) of the low-mass binary\u000amillisecond pulsar PSR B1620-26 can be explained naturally as arising from the\u000asecular perturbation of a second, more distant companion. Such a triple\u000aconfiguration has been proposed recently as the most likely cause of the\u000aanomalous second period derivative of the pulsar. The current timing data are\u000aconsistent with a second companion mass $m_2$ as low as $\u005csim10^{-3}\u005c,M_\u005codot$,\u000ai.e., comparable to that of Jupiter. However, {\u005cem if\u005c/} the eccentricity is\u000aindeed produced by secular perturbations, then the second companion must be\u000aanother star, most likely of mass $m_2\u005clo1M_\u005codot$ and in a very eccentric\u000a($e_2\u005cgo0.5$) orbit of period $P_2\u005csim10^2$--$10^3\u005c,$yr. A second companion of\u000aplanetary mass cannot induce the observed eccentricity. Independent of the mass\u000aof the second companion, small changes in the binary pulsar's orbit should\u000abecome detectable with just a few additional years of timing data. This\u000adetection would provide direct confirmation of the triple nature of the system,\u000aand an accurate measurement of the effects would place important new\u000aconstraints on the orbital parameters.\u000a

V  Starquakes are considered for fast-rotating magnetic white dwarfs. The X-ray\u000apulsar 1E 2259 + 586 may be such a white dwarf. It is shown that in this case\u000astarquakes may be responsible for the decrease of the mean spin-down rate which\u000awas observed for 1E 2259 + 586 between 1987 and 1990. The required mass of the\u000awhite dwarf which is identified with 1E 2259 + 586 is $\u005csim 1.4 - 1.5 M_\u005codot$,\u000amaking this X-ray pulsar the most massive white dwarf known.\u000a

V  It is well known that the standard transport equations violate causality when\u000agradients are large or when temporal variations are rapid. We derive a modified\u000aset of transport equations that satisfy causality. These equations are obtained\u000afrom the underlying Boltzmann equation. We use a simple model for particle\u000acollisions which enables us to derive moment equations non-perturbatively, i.e.\u000awithout making the usual assumption that the distribution function deviates\u000aonly slightly from its equilibrium value. We apply the model to two problems:\u000aparticle diffusion and viscous transport. In both cases we show that signals\u000apropagate at a finite speed and therefore that the formalism obeys causality.\u000aWhen the velocity gradient is large on the scale of a mean free path, the\u000aviscous shear stress is suppressed relative to the prediction of the standard\u000adiffusion approximation. The shear stress reaches a maximum at a finite value\u000aof the shear amplitude and then decreases as the velocity gradient increases.\u000aIn the case of a steady Keplerian accretion disk with hydrodynamic turbulent\u000aviscosity, the stress-limit translates to an upper bound on the Shakura-Sunyaev\u000a$\u005calpha$-parameter, namely $\u005calpha<0.07$. The limit on $\u005calpha$ is much\u000astronger in narrow boundary layers where the velocity shear is larger than\u000aKeplerian.\u000a

V  We examine extended inflation models enhanced by the addition of a coupling\u000abetween the inflaton field and the space-time curvature. We examine two types\u000aof model, where the underlying inflaton potential takes on second-order and\u000afirst-order form respectively. One aim is to provide models which satisfy the\u000asolar system constraints on the Brans--Dicke parameter $\u005comega$. This\u000aconstraint has proven very problematic in previous extended inflation models,\u000aand we find circumstances where it can be successfully evaded, though the\u000aconstraint must be carefully assessed in our model and can be much stronger\u000athan the usual $\u005comega > 500$. In the simplest versions of the model, one may\u000aavoid the need to introduce a mass for the Brans--Dicke field in order to\u000aensure that it takes on the correct value at the present epoch, as seems to be\u000arequired in hyperextended inflation. We also briefly discuss aspects of the\u000aformation of topological defects in the inflaton field itself.\u000a

V  In the current paradigm there is a non-trivial bias expected in the process\u000aof galaxy formation. Thus, the observed statistical properties of the galaxy\u000adistribution do not necessarily extend to the underlying matter distribution.\u000aGravitational evolution of initially Gaussian seed fluctuations predicts that\u000athe connected moments of the matter fluctuations exhibit a hierarchical\u000astructure, at least in the limit of small dispersion. This same hierarchical\u000astructure has been found in the galaxy distribution, but it is not clear to\u000awhat extent it reflects properties of the matter distribution or properties of\u000aa galaxy formation bias. In this paper we consider the consequences of an\u000aarbitrary, effectively local biasing transformation of a hierarchical\u000aunderlying matter distribution. We show that a general form of such a\u000atransformation preserves the hierarchical properties and the shape of the\u000adispersion in the limit of small fluctuations, i.e. on large scales, although\u000athe values of the\u000a

V  Nonlinear approximation methods such as the Zeldovich approximation, and more\u000arecently the frozen flow and linear potential approximations, are sometimes\u000aused to simulate nonlinear gravitational instability in the expanding Universe.\u000aWe investigate the relative accuracy of these approximations by comparing them\u000awith the exact solution using second order perturbation theory. We evaluate the\u000adensity and velocity fields in these approximations to second order, and also\u000adetermine the skewness parameter $S_3 = \u005clangle \u005cdelta^3 \u005crangle / \u005clangle\u000a(\u005cdelta^{(1)})^2\u005crangle ^2$ for each of the approximations again in second\u000aorder. We find that $S_3 = 4, ~3, ~3.4$ for the Zeldovich approximation, the\u000afrozen flow and the linear potential approximations respectively as compared to\u000a$S_3 = {34/7}$ for the exact solution. Our results show that, of all the\u000aapproximations considered, the Zeldovich approximation is the most accurate in\u000adescribing the weakly nonlinear effects of gravity. Moreover, the Zeldovich\u000aapproximation is much closer to the exact results for matter and velocity\u000adistributions than the other approximations if the slope of the power spectrum\u000aof density perturbations is $-3< n \u005cle -1$.\u000a

V  The quantum Brownian motion paradigm provides a unified framework where one\u000acan see the interconnection of some basic quantum statistical processes like\u000adecoherence, dissipation, particle creation, noise and fluctuation. We treat\u000athe case where the Brownian particle is coupled linearly to a bath of time\u000adependent quadratic oscillators. While the bath mimics a scalar field, the\u000amotion of the Brownian particle modeled by a single oscillator could be used to\u000adepict the behavior of a particle detector, a quantum field mode or the scale\u000afactor of the universe. An important result of this paper is the derivation of\u000athe influence functional encompassing the noise and dissipation kernels in\u000aterms of the Bogolubov coefficients. This method enables one to trace the\u000asource of statistical processes like decoherence and dissipation to vacuum\u000afluctuations and particle creation, and in turn impart a statistical mechanical\u000ainterpretation of quantum field processes. With this result we discuss the\u000astatistical mechanical origin of quantum noise and thermal radiance from black\u000aholes and from uniformly- accelerated observers in Minkowski space as well as\u000afrom the de Sitter universe discovered by Hawking, Unruh and Gibbons-Hawking.\u000aWe also derive the exact evolution operator and master equation for the reduced\u000adensity matrix of the system interacting with a parametric oscillator bath in\u000aan initial squeezed thermal state. These results are useful for decoherence and\u000abackreaction studies for systems and processes of interest in semiclassical\u000acosmology and gravity. Our model and results are also expected to be useful for\u000arelated problems in quantum optics. %\u005cpacs\u000a{05.40.+j,03.65.Sq,98.80.Cq,97.60.Lf}\u000a

V  One dimensional, convective, vertical structure models and one dimensional,\u000atime dependent, radial diffusion models are combined to create a\u000aself-consistent picture in which FU~Orionis outbursts occur in young stellar\u000aobjects (YSOs) as the result of a large scale, self-regulated, thermal\u000aionization instability in the surrounding protostellar accretion disk. By\u000afitting the results of time dependent disk models to observed time scales of\u000aFU~Orionis events, we estimate the magnitude of the effeciency of the effective\u000aviscous stress in the inner disk (r < 1 AU) to be, in accordance with the ad\u000ahoc ``alpha'' prescription, 10^{-4} where hydrogen is neutral and 10^{-3} where\u000ahydrogen is ionized. We hypothesize that all YSOs receive infall onto their\u000aouter disks which is steady (or slowly declining with time) and that FU~Orionis\u000aoutbursts are self-regulated, disk outbursts which occur only in systems which\u000atransport matter inward at a rate sufficiently high to cause hydrogen to be\u000aionized in the inner disk. We estimate a critical mass flux of 5x10^{-7} solar\u000amasses / year {\u005cit independent of the magnitude of alpha} for systems with one\u000asolar mass, three solar radius central objects. Infall accretion rates in the\u000arange of (1-10)x10^{-6} solar masses per year produce observed FU~Orionis time\u000ascales consistent with estimates of spherical molecular cloud core collapse\u000arates.\u000a

V  Aside from primordial gravitational instability of the cosmological fluid,\u000avarious mechanisms have been proposed to generate large-scale structure at\u000arelatively late times, including, e.g., ``late-time'' cosmological phase\u000atransitions. In these scenarios, it is envisioned that the universe is nearly\u000ahomogeneous at the time of last scattering and that perturbations grow rapidly\u000asometime after the primordial plasma recombines. On this basis, it was\u000asuggested that large inhomogeneities could be generated while leaving\u000arelatively little imprint on the cosmic microwave background (MBR) anisotropy.\u000aIn this paper, we calculate the minimal anisotropies possible in any\u000a``late-time'' scenario for structure formation, given the level of\u000ainhomogeneity observed at present. Since the growth of the inhomogeneity\u000ainvolves time-varying gravitational fields, these scenarios inevitably generate\u000asignificant MBR anisotropy via the Sachs-Wolfe effect. Moreover, we show that\u000athe large-angle MBR anisotropy produced by the rapid post-recombination growth\u000aof inhomogeneity is generally greater than that produced by the same\u000ainhomogeneity grown via gravitational instability. In ``realistic'' scenarios\u000aone can decrease the anisotropy compared to models with primordial adiabatic\u000afluctuations, but only on very small angular scales. The value of any\u000aparticular measure of the anisotropy can be made small in late-time models, but\u000aonly by making the time-dependence of the gravitational field sufficiently\u000a``pathological''.\u000a

V  A detailed study of the mixed-morphology galaxy pair CPG 29 (Arp 119, VV 347)\u000ashows spectacular spectroscopic peculiarities in the southern (spiral)\u000acomponent (Mkn 984) including a spatially resolved region, roughly aligned\u000aalong the minor axis of the galaxy, with multiple emission-line components\u000aredshifted by as much as 1300 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the LINER nucleus.\u000aStrong [OI]\u005cl6300 and [SII]\u005cl\u005cl6716,6731 emission suggest shock ionization. The\u000arest of the galaxy's disk is spectroscopically undistinguished, with emission\u000alines characteristic of disk H II regions and, in large part, ordered rotation.\u000aWe discuss the following four possible explanations for the morphological and\u000aspectroscopic peculiarities in the spiral: (1) a super--wind scenario,\u000asupported by the high FIR luminosity of the spiral, and by emission line\u000aactivity similar to that observed in FIR strong galaxies; (2) motion of the\u000aspiral through a hot, relatively dense intergalactic medium, possibly\u000aassociated with the elliptical, that could affect the star formation rate and\u000acreate a brightened disk rim; (3) a faint companion in direct collision with\u000athe disk, at $\u005cDelta v_r \u005csim 1000$ \u005ckms, that would straightforwardly explain\u000athe existence of the different redshift systems; (4) a pole on collision by the\u000aelliptical, that could produce the disturbed morphology and other properties of\u000athe spiral. The elliptical/spiral pole--on collision explains the high velocity\u000aline emitting regions as tidally stripped gas, and accounts for the presence of\u000agas ionized by moterate velocity shocks. The morphology of Mrk 984 is\u000aconsistent\u000a

V  ABSRACT:We show how to use 21-cm emission and absorption studies to estimate\u000athe heat inputs to the neutral gas in low pressure environments, such as in\u000aouter disks of spiral galaxies, in galactic halos or in intergalactic space.\u000aFor a range of model parameters we calculate the gas kinetic and spin\u000atemperatures ($T_K$ and $T_S$) and the relation between $T_S$ and the heat\u000ainput to the gas. We outline the conditions for a ``two phase medium'' to\u000aexist. We find that although $T_S$ can be much smaller than $T_K$, $T_S$ is\u000aalways $ \u005cgg 3$ K for column densities greater that $5 \u005ctimes 10^{18}$\u000acm$^{-2}$. This excludes the possibility that relevant HI masses at the\u000aperiphery of galaxies are invisible at 21-cm in emission. The outermost\u000ainterstellar gas in a disk galaxy is more directly affected by external\u000aprocesses and in this paper we estimate the intensity of the extragalactic\u000abackground at energies close to 0.1 keV by comparing our theoretical results\u000awith HI emission/absorption studies. We take into account the possibility that\u000asome energy produced in the inner regions affects the energy balance in outer\u000aregions. We find that in the absence of any other local heat source QSO\u000adominated background models are still compatible with the spin temperature\u000alimits derived for the two best documented HI emission/absorption studies in\u000aouter regions.\u000a

V  We examine the possibility that gamma-ray bursts arise from sources in the\u000aOort comet cloud, basing most of our arguments on accepted models for the\u000aformation and spatial distribution of the cloud. We identify three severe\u000aproblems with such models: (1) There is no known mechanism for producing bursts\u000athat can explain the observed burst rate and energetics without violating other\u000aobservational constraints. (2) The bright source counts cannot be reconciled\u000awith standard models for the phase-space distribution of objects in the Oort\u000acloud. (3) The observed isotropy of the available burst data is inconsistent\u000awith the expected angular distribution of sources in the Oort cloud. We\u000atherefore assert that Oort cloud models of gamma-ray bursts are extremely\u000aimplausible.\u000a

V  If the Universe is open, scales larger than the curvature scale may be probed\u000aby large-angle fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We\u000aconsider primordial adiabatic perturbations and discuss power spectra that are\u000apower laws in volume, wavelength, and eigenvalue of the Laplace operator. The\u000aresulting large-angle anisotropies of the CMB are computed. The amplitude\u000agenerally increases as $\u005cOmega$ is decreased, but decreases as $h$ is\u000aincreased. Interestingly enough, for all three ansatzes, anisotropies on\u000aangular scales larger than the curvature scale are suppressed relative to the\u000aanisotropies on scales smaller than the curvature scale. Models with\u000a$0.2<\u005cOmega h<0.3$ appear compatible with CMB fluctuations detected by COBE and\u000aTenerife and with the amplitude and spectrum of fluctuations of galaxy counts\u000ain galaxy surveys. COBE normalization for these models yields $\u005csigma_8\u005csimeq\u000a0.5-0.7$. Models with smaller values of $\u005cOmega h$ when normalized to COBE\u000arequire bias factors in excess of 2 to be compatible with the observed galaxy\u000acounts on the $8/h$ Mpc scale. Requiring that the age of the universe exceed 10\u000aGyr implies that $\u005cOmega>0.25$, while requiring that the age exceed 13 Gyr\u000aimplies that $\u005cOmega>0.35$. Unlike in the flat-Universe case where the\u000aanisotropy comes only from the last-scattering term in the Sachs-Wolfe formula,\u000alarge-angle anisotropies come primarily from the decay of potential\u000afluctuations at $z<1/\u005cOmega$. Thus, if the Universe is open, COBE has been\u000adetecting fluctuations produced at moderate redshift rather than at $z\u005csim\u000a1300$.\u000a

V  Detailed comparisons are made between observations of scattered light\u000aupstream of the head of the HH~1 jet and predictions of simple scattering\u000amodels. It is shown that, in order to unambiguously determine the velocity of\u000athe head of the jet (bow shock) with respect to the upstream dust, existing\u000aspectroscopic observations are insufficient and that spectropolarimetric\u000aobservations of the scattered light are necessary. Such an independent measure\u000aof the bow shock velocity is important in order to test ``multiple outflow''\u000atheories of Herbig-Haro jets. It is also shown 2that the scattering dust must\u000ahave a very forward-throwing scattering phase function\u000a($\u005clangle\u005ccos\u005ctheta\u005crangle\u005cmsim 0.7$) and slight evidence is found for a\u000adust-gas ratio that is higher than average.\u000a

V  We present new estimates of the observed rates of SNe determined with the\u000a{\u005cem control time} method applied to the files of observations of two long\u000aterm, photographic SN searches carried out at the Asiago and Sternberg\u000aObservatories. Our calculations are applied to a galaxy sample extracted from\u000aRC3, in which 65 SNe have been discovered. This relatively large number of SNe\u000ahas been redistributed in the different morphological classes of host galaxies\u000agiving the respective SN rates. The magnitude of two biases, the overexposure\u000aof the central part of galaxies and the inclination of the spiral parent\u000agalaxies, have been estimated. We show that due to overexposure a increasing\u000afraction of SNe is lost in galaxies of increasing distances. Also, a reduced\u000anumber of SNe is discovered in inclined galaxies ($i>30\u005cdegr$): SNII and Ib are\u000amore affected than Ia, as well as SNe in Sbc-Sd galaxies with respect to other\u000aspirals. We strengthen previous findings that the SN rates is proportional to\u000athe galaxy blue luminosity for all SN and Hubble types. Other sources of\u000aerrors, besides those due to the statistics of the events, have been\u000ainvestigated. In particular those related to the adopted SN parameters\u000a(Cappellaro et al. (\u005ccite{paper1})) and correction factor for overexposure and\u000ainclination. Moreover, we show that the frequencies of SNe per unit luminosity\u000avary if different sources for the parameters of the sample galaxies are\u000aadopted, thus hampering the comparison of SN rates based on different galaxy\u000asamples. The overall rates per unit blue luminosity are similar to the previous\u000a

V  The problem of neutral-current processes (neutrino scattering, pair emission,\u000apair absorption, axion emission, \u005cetc) in a nuclear medium can be separated\u000ainto an expression representing the phase space of the weakly interacting\u000aprobe, and a set of dynamic structure functions of the medium. For a\u000anon-relativistic medium we reduce the description to two structure functions\u000a$S_A(\u005co)$ and $S_V(\u005co)$ of the energy transfer, representing the axial-vector\u000aand vector interactions. $S_V$ is well determined by the single-nucleon\u000aapproximation while $S_A$ may be dominated by multiply interacting nucleons.\u000aUnless the shape of $S_A(\u005co)$ changes dramatically at high densities,\u000ascattering processes always dominate over pair processes for neutrino transport\u000aor the emission of right-handed states. Because the emission of right-handed\u000aneutrinos and axions is controlled by the same medium response functions, a\u000aconsistent constraint on their properties from consideration of supernova\u000acooling should use the same structure functions for both neutrino transport and\u000aexotic cooling mechanisms.\u000a

V  We present the results of detailed nuclear shell model calculations of the\u000aspin-dependent elastic cross section for neutralinos scattering from \u005csi29 and\u000a\u005cge73. The calculations were performed in large model spaces which adequately\u000adescribe the configuration mixing in these two nuclei. As tests of the computed\u000anuclear wave functions, we have calculated several nuclear observables and\u000acompared them with the measured values and found good agreement. In the limit\u000aof zero momentum transfer, we find scattering matrix elements in agreement with\u000aprevious estimates for \u005csi29 but significantly different than previous work for\u000a\u005cge73. A modest quenching, in accord with shell model studies of other heavy\u000anuclei, has been included to bring agreement between the measured and\u000acalculated values of the magnetic moment for \u005cge73. Even with this quenching,\u000athe calculated scattering rate is roughly a factor of 2 higher than the best\u000aprevious estimates; without quenching, the rate is a factor of 4 higher. This\u000aimplies a higher sensitivity for germanium dark matter detectors. We also\u000ainvestigate the role of finite momentum transfer upon the scattering response\u000afor both nuclei and find that this can significantly change the expected rates.\u000aWe close with a brief discussion of the effects of some of the non-nuclear\u000auncertainties upon the matrix elements.\u000a

V  Transitions in a system of neutrinos with vacuum mixing and magnetic moments,\u000apropagating in matter and transverse magnetic field, are considered. It is\u000ashown that in the realistic case of magnetic field direction varying along the\u000aneutrino path qualitatively new phenomena become possible: permutation of\u000aneutrino conversion resonances, appearance of resonances in the\u000aneutrino-antineutrino ($\u005cnu_{lL}\u005cleftrightarrow\u005cbar{\u005cnu}_{lR}$) transition\u000achannels, neutrino-antineutrino resonant conversion, large amplitude\u000a$\u005cnu_{lL}\u005cleftrightarrow\u005cbar{\u005cnu}_{lR}$ oscillations, merging of different\u000aresonances (triple resonances).

V  We compute the evolution of spatially flat, mixed cold and hot dark matter\u000a(``MDM") models containing both baryonic matter and two kinds of dark matter.\u000aThe mean final Zeldovich-Sunyaev $y$ parameter is estimated to be $\u005cbar\u000ay=(5.4\u005cpm 2.7)\u005ctimes 10^{-7}$, with a rms fluctuation of approximately\u000a$\u005cbar{\u005cdelta y}=(6.0\u005cpm 3.0)\u005ctimes 10^{-7}$ on arc minute scales. The rate of\u000agalaxy formation peaks at an even later epoch ($z\u005csim 0.3$) than in the\u000astandard ($\u005cOmega=1$, $\u005csigma_8=0.67$) CDM model ($z\u005csim 0.5$) and, at a\u000aredshift of z=4 is nearly a factor of a hundred lower than for the CDM model\u000awith the same value of $\u005csigma_8$. The model yields a cluster mass function\u000awhich is about a factor of 4 higher than observed but a cluster-cluster\u000acorrelation length lower by a factor of 2 than what is observed but both are\u000acloser to observations than in the COBE normalized CDM model. The one\u000adimensional pairwise velocity dispersion is $605\u005cpm 8$km/s at $1h^{-1}$\u000aseparation, lower than that of the CDM model normalized to COBE, but still\u000asignificantly higher than observations (Davis \u005c& Peebles 1983). A plausible\u000avelocity bias $b_v=0.8\u005cpm 0.1$ on this scale will reduce but not remove the\u000adiscrepancy. Overall, the model is similar both on large and intermediate\u000ascales to the standard CDM model normalized to the same value of $\u005csigma_8$,\u000abut the problem with regard to late formation of galaxies is more severe in\u000athis model than in that CDM model. Adding hot dark matter significantly\u000aimproves the ability of COBE normalized CDM scenario to fit existing\u000aobservations, but the model is in fact not as good as the CDM model with the\u000asame $\u005csigma_8$ and is still probably unsatisfactory with regard to several\u000acritical tests.\u000a

V  There are no good predictions for the amplitudes expected from solar-like\u000aoscillations in other stars. In the absence of a definitive model for\u000aconvection, which is thought to be the mechanism that excites these\u000aoscillations, the amplitudes for both velocity and luminosity measurements must\u000abe estimated by scaling from the Sun. In the case of luminosity measurements,\u000aeven this is difficult because of disagreement over the solar amplitude.\u000a  This last point has lead us to investigate whether the luminosity amplitude\u000aof oscillations (dL/L) can be derived from the velocity amplitude v_osc. Using\u000alinear theory and observational data, we show that p-mode oscillations in a\u000alarge sample of pulsating stars satisfy\u000a  (dL/L)_bol proportional to v_osc/T_eff. Using this relationship, together\u000awith the best estimate of v_osc(Sun) = (23.4 +/- 1.4) cm/s, we estimate the\u000aluminosity amplitude of solar oscillations at 550 nm to be dL/L = (4.7 +/- 0.3)\u000appm.\u000a  Next we discuss how to scale the amplitude of solar-like (i.e.,\u000aconvectively-powered) oscillations from the Sun to other stars. The only\u000apredictions come from model calculations by (Christensen-Dalsgaard & Frandsen,\u000aSol. Phys. 82, 469). However, their grid of stellar models is not dense enough\u000ato allow amplitude predictions for an arbitrary star. Nevertheless, although\u000aconvective theory is complicated, we might expect that the general properties\u000aof convection -- including oscillation amplitudes -- should change smoothly\u000athrough the colour-magnitude diagram. Indeed, we find that the velocity\u000aamplitudes predicted by the model\u000a

V  Arp 299C is a $5 \u005ctimes 10^{10}$ \u005cLsun infrared source in the merging galaxy\u000asystem Arp 299. It is the most luminous object known that is not obviously\u000aassociated with a galaxy nucleus. Our data show that the 8--13 \u005cmum spectrum of\u000aArp 299C has a strong \u005cNeII emission line and emission features like those of\u000apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules. These emission features are\u000acharacteristic of \u005cHII regions associated with a burst of star formation. We\u000adid not detect any high-excitation ionic lines characteristic of an active\u000agalactic nucleus, nor a deep silicate absorption feature that might indicate a\u000ahidden compact nucleus. We deduce that Arp 299C is powered by an intense burst\u000aof star formation.\u000a

V  We derive a formula for the nonequilibrium entropy of a classical stochastic\u000afield in terms of correlation functions of this field. The formalism is then\u000aapplied to define the entropy of gravitational perturbations (both\u000agravitational waves and density fluctuations). We calculate this entropy in a\u000aspecific cosmological model (the inflationary Universe) and find that on scales\u000aof interest in cosmology the entropy in both density perturbations and\u000agravitational waves exceeds the entropy of statistical fluctuations of the\u000amicrowave background. The nonequilibrium entropy discussed here is a measure of\u000aloss of information about the system. We discuss the origin of the entropy in\u000aour cosmological models and compare the definition of entropy in terms of\u000acorrelation functions with the microcanonical definition in quantum statistical\u000amechanics.\u000a

V  We show how to simulate the clustering of rich clusters of galaxies using a\u000atechnique based on the Zel'dovich approximation. This method well reproduces\u000athe spatial distribution of clusters obtainable from full N-body simulations at\u000aa fraction of the computational cost. We use an ensemble of large--scale\u000asimulations to assess the level and statistical significance of cluster\u000aclustering in open, tilted and flat versions of the Cold Dark Matter (CDM)\u000amodel, as well as a model comprising a mixture of Cold and Hot Dark Matter\u000a(CHDM). We find the open and flat CDM models are excluded by the data. The\u000atilted CDM model with a slight tilt is in marginal agreement, while larger tilt\u000aproduces the right amount of clustering; CHDM is the best of all our models at\u000areproducing the observations of cluster clustering. We find that {\u005cem all} our\u000amodels display a systematically weaker relationship between clustering length\u000aand mean cluster separation than seems to be implied by observations. We also\u000anote that the cluster bias factor, is not constant in any of the models,\u000ashowing that one needs to be very careful when relating cluster clustering\u000astatistics to primordial density fluctuations.\u000a

V  The measurement or constraint of the masses of neutron stars and their binary\u000acompanions tests theories of neutron star structure and of pulsar formation and\u000aevolution. We have measured the rate of the general relativistic advance of the\u000alongitude of periastron for the pulsar PSR B1802$-$07:\u000a$\u005cdot\u005comega=0\u005cfdg060\u005cpm0\u005cfdg009\u005c,\u005cmbox{yr}^{-1}$, which implies a total system\u000amass, pulsar plus companion star, of $M=1.7\u005cpm0.4\u005c,\u005cMsun$. We also present a\u000amuch improved measurement of the rate of periastron advance for PSR B2303+46:\u000a$\u005cdot\u005comega = 0\u005cfdg0099\u005cpm0\u005cfdg0002\u005c,\u005cmbox{yr}^{-1}$, implying\u000a$M=2.53\u005cpm0.08\u005c,\u005cMsun$ for this system. We discuss the available constraints on\u000adistribution of mass between the pulsars and their companions, and we compare\u000athe pulsar masses with other determinations of neutron star masses.\u000a

V  We extend and develop our previous work on the evolution of a network of\u000acosmic strings. The new treatment is based on an analysis of the probability\u000adistribution of the end-to-end distance of a randomly chosen segment of\u000aleft-moving string of given length. The description involves three distinct\u000alength scales: $\u005cxi$, related to the overall string density, $\u005cbar\u005cxi$, the\u000apersistence length along the string, and $\u005czeta$, describing the small-scale\u000astructure, which is an important feature of the numerical simulations that have\u000abeen done of this problem. An evolution equation is derived describing how the\u000adistribution develops in time due to the combined effects of the universal\u000aexpansion, of intercommuting and loop formation, and of gravitational\u000aradiation. With plausible assumptions about the unknown parameters in the\u000amodel, we confirm the conclusions of our previous study, that if gravitational\u000aradiation and small-scale structure effects are neglected, the two dominant\u000alength scales both scale in proportion to the horizon size. When the extra\u000aeffects are included, we find that while $\u005cxi$ and $\u005cbar\u005cxi$ grow, $\u005czeta$\u000ainitially does not. Eventually, however, it does appear to scale, at a much\u000alower level, due to the effects of gravitational back-reaction.\u000a

One mode, different from the one envoked in\u000amost extended models to date, easily avoids making big bubbles that distort the\u000acosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR). In this mode, the spectrum of\u000adensity fluctuations is found to be scale-free, $P(k) \u005cpropto k^n$, where $n$\u000amight lie anywhere between 0.5 and 1.0 (whereas, previously, it appeared that\u000athe range $1.0> n \u005cgtsim 0.84$ was disallowed).\u000a

V  This preprint is based on two articles accepted by MNRAS and ApJ.\u000a  Our aim is to study the evolution of the orbit of a star under the influence\u000aof interactions with an accretion disc in an AGN. The model considered consists\u000aof a low-mass compact object orbiting a supermassive black hole and colliding\u000aperiodically with the accretion disc. Gravitational field of the nucleus is\u000adescribed by the Kerr metric. The star is assumed to move along a geodesic arc\u000abetween successive interactions with an equatorial accretion disc. We study the\u000agravitomagnetic (Lense-Thirring) precession of the trajectory. We do not assume\u000aany particular value for the eccentricity or inclination of the orbit or the\u000aangular momentum of the black hole. We also discuss the periodicity related to\u000athe relativistic shift of the pericenter.\u000a  The model of star-disc interactions has been suggested to explain the X-ray\u000avariability observed in the Seyfert galaxy NGC~6814. We briefly discuss on this\u000asubject.\u000a

V  We present spectrophotometric observations of the Broad Line Radio Galaxy OQ\u000a208 (Mrk 668, 1404+286) obtained between 1985 and 1991. We show that the Balmer\u000aline fluxes and profile shapes undergo remarkable changes. The ratio of\u000aintensities between the broad and narrow components of Hbeta increased\u000amonotonically from 15 in 1985 to 40 in 1991. The peak of the broad components\u000aof Hbeta and Halpha were known to be strongly displaced to the red. We have\u000adiscovered a correlation between the amplitude of the broad peak displacement\u000aand the luminosity of Hbeta, in the sense that the displacement is larger when\u000athe line luminosity is higher. We suggest that the observations are not\u000acompatible with either a binary Broad Line Region model or one involving\u000aballistic acceleration of the line emitting gas. Radiative acceleration of a\u000asystem of outflowing clouds readily explains the correlation between line shift\u000aand luminosity as well as the peculiar line profiles. Furthermore, it seems\u000athat most or all of the Balmer emission originates from the inward face of the\u000aclouds. Theoretical line profiles suggest that the observed Hbeta profile is\u000abest fit assuming the contribution of an ensemble which might be spherical or\u000aconfined in a thick disk in addition to a component emitted in a thin shell\u000acontained in a cone of half opening angle 12 degrees seen along its axis.\u000a

V  A simple test for time-asymmetry is devised and carried out on the brightest\u000agamma-ray bursts detected by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE)\u000aon board the {\u005cit Compton} Gamma Ray Observatory. We show evidence that\u000aindividual bursts are time-asymmetric on all time scales tested, from a time\u000ascale shorter than that of pulses which compose GRBs to a time scale similar to\u000aa greater envelope that contains these pulses. We also find bursts which\u000amanifest significant asymmetry only on time scales comparable to the duration\u000aof burst, and bursts for which no clear asymmetry on any time scale is present.\u000aThe sense of the asymmetry is that bursts and/or component structures rise in a\u000ashorter time than they decay. We also find that our whole sample of bursts\u000ataken together is time- asymmetric, in that there are significantly more bursts\u000aand pulses where the rise is more rapid than the decay, on all time scales\u000atested and for all energy bands tested. When our whole GRB sample is binned at\u000a64-ms and integrated over all BATSE energies, the statistical significance is\u000aat the 6 $\u005csigma$ level. Models that predict time-symmetry are therefore\u000aexcluded.\u000a

The decrease in orbital period may also occur by radiation of other\u000amassless particles like scalars and pseudoscalar Nambu-Goldstone bosons.\u000aAssuming that this energy loss is less than one percent of the gravitational\u000aradiation, we can establish bounds on couplings of these particles to nucleons.\u000aFor a scalar nucleon coupling of the form $g_s~\u005cphi~\u005cbar\u005cpsi~\u005cpsi$ we find that\u000a$g_s< 3\u005ctimes 10^{-19}$.

V  We investigate the associations between background galaxies and foreground\u000aclusters of galaxies due to the effect of gravitational lensing by clusters of\u000agalaxies. Similar to the well-known quasar-galaxy ones, these associations\u000adepend sensitively on the shape of galaxy number-magnitude or number-flux\u000arelation, and both positive and ``negative" associations are found to be\u000apossible, depending on the limiting magnitude and/or the flux threshold in the\u000asurveys. We calculate the enhancement factors assuming a singular isothermal\u000asphere model for clusters of galaxies and a pointlike model for background\u000asources selected in three different wavelengths, $B$, $K$ and radio. Our\u000aresults show that $K-$ selected galaxies might constitute the best sample to\u000atest the ``negative" associations while it is unlikely that one can actually\u000aobserve any association for blue galaxies. We also point out that bright radio\u000asources ($S>1$ Jy) can provide strong positive associations, which may have\u000abeen already detected in 3CR sample.\u000a

V  The galactic magnetic field is commonly supposed to be due to a dynamo acting\u000aon some large scale seed field. A major difficulty with this idea is that\u000aestimates of reasonable seed field strengths tend to be quite low, on the order\u000aof $\u005csim10^{-20}$ gauss. Here we examine the contribution due to the flux\u000aentrained in winds from protostars formed in the first dynamo e-folding time of\u000aa galaxy's existence. Using a minimal estimate of a protostellar magnetic field\u000awe find that if each protostar ejects a single current ring, sufficient to\u000amaintain flux freezing in the wind, than the large scale average dipole field\u000afrom all such current rings will be at least 5 orders of magnitude larger than\u000aprevious seed field estimates. Allowing for a reasonable amount of magnetic\u000aactivity in protostars during an extended period of mass loss increases this to\u000aa dipole seed field of $\u005csim10^{-12}$ gauss. For the purposes of producing a\u000aseed field it is irrelevant whether or not this initial injection of flux takes\u000aplace in a newly formed galactic disk, or in star forming proto-galactic\u000aclouds. The compression of this dipole field into a thin disk will lead to a\u000alarge scale $B_r\u005csim 10^{-10.5}$ gauss. Initially, field strengths on smaller\u000ascales will be larger, but nowhere near current levels.\u000a

V  If massive black holes constitute the dark matter in the halo surrounding the\u000aMilky Way, the existence of low mass globular clusters in the halo suggests an\u000aupper limit to their mass, $M_{_{BH}}$. We use a combination of the impulse\u000aapproximation and numerical simulations to constrain $M_{_{BH}} \u005clsim\u000a10^3M_\u005codot$, otherwise several of the halo globular clusters would be heated\u000ato disruption within one half of their lifetime. Taken at face value, this\u000aconstraint is three orders of magnitude stronger than the previous limit\u000aprovided by disk heating arguments. However, since the initial mass function of\u000aclusters is unknown, we argue that the real constraint is at most, an order of\u000amagnitude weaker. Our results rule out cosmological scenarios, such as versions\u000aof the Primordial Baryonic Isocurvature fluctuation model, which invoke the low\u000aJeans mass at early epochs to create a large population of black holes of mass\u000a$\u005csim 10^6M_\u005codot$.\u000a

V  We present a detailed study of inhomogeneous Big Bang nucleosynthesis where,\u000afor the first time, nuclear reactions are coupled to all significant\u000afluctuation dissipation processes. Theses processes include neutrino heat\u000atransport, baryon diffusion, photon diffusive heat transport, and hydrodynamic\u000aexpansion with photon-electron Thomson drag. Light element abundance yields are\u000apresented for broad ranges of initial amplitudes and length scales for\u000aspherically condensed fluctuations. The $^2$H, $^3$He, $^4$He, and $^7$Li\u000anucleosynthesis yields are found to be inconsistent with observationally\u000ainferred primordial abundances for all but very narrow ranges of fluctuation\u000acharacteristics. Rapid hydrodynamic expansion of fluctuations late in the\u000anucleosynthesis epoch results in significant destruction of $^7$Li ($^7$Be)\u000aonly if the baryonic conytribution to the closure density ($\u005cOmega_b$) is less\u000athan or comparable to the upper limit on this quantity from homogeneous Big\u000aBang nucleosynthesis. This implies that $^7$Li overproduction will peclude an\u000aincrease on the upper limit for $\u005cOmega_b$ for any inhomogeneous\u000anucleosynthesis scenarios employing spherically condensed fluctuations.\u000a

V  The peculiar velocities of galaxies distort the pattern of galaxy clustering\u000ain redshift space, making the redshift space power spectrum anisotropic. In the\u000alinear regime, the strength of this distortion depends only on the ratio $\u005cbeta\u000a\u005cequiv f(\u005cOmega)/b \u005capprox \u005cOmega^{0.6}/b$, where $\u005cOmega$ is the cosmological\u000adensity parameter and $b$ is the bias parameter. We derive a linear theory\u000aestimator for $\u005cbeta$ based on the harmonic moments of the redshift space power\u000aspectrum. Using N-body simulations, we examine the impact of non-linear\u000agravitational clustering on the power spectrum anisotropy and on our\u000a$\u005cbeta$-estimator. Non-linear effects can be important out to wavelengths\u000a$\u005clambda \u005csim 50$Mpc/h or larger; in most cases, they lower the quadrupole\u000amoment of the power spectrum and thereby depress the estimate of $\u005cbeta$ below\u000athe true value. With a sufficiently large redshift survey, the scaling of\u000anon-linear effects may allow separate determinations of $\u005cOmega$ and $b$.\u000a  We describe a practical technique for measuring the anisotropy of the power\u000aspectrum from galaxy redshift surveys, and we test the technique on mock\u000acatalogues drawn from the N-body simulations. Preliminary application of our\u000amethods to the 1.2 Jy IRAS galaxy survey yields $\u005cbeta_{est} \u005csim 0.3-0.4 $ at\u000awavelengths $\u005clambda \u005csim 30-40$Mpc/h . Non-linear effects remain important at\u000athese scales, so this estimate of $\u005cbeta$ is probably lower than the true\u000avalue.\u000a

V  We study the effect of the non-Gaussian clustering of galaxies on the\u000astatistics of pencil beam surveys. We find that the higher order moments of the\u000agalaxy distribution play an important role in the probability distribution for\u000athe power spectrum peaks. Taking into account the observed values for the\u000akurtosis of galaxy distribution we derive the general probability distribution\u000afor the power spectrum modes in non-Gaussian models and show that the\u000aprobability to obtain the 128$\u005chm$ periodicity found in pencil beam surveys is\u000araised by roughly one order of magnitude. The non-Gaussianity of the galaxy\u000adistribution is however still insufficient to explain the reported\u000apeak-to-noise ratio of the periodicity, so that extra power on large scales\u000aseems required.\u000a

V  We challenge a widely accepted assumption of observational cosmology: that\u000asuccessful reconstruction of observed galaxy density fields from measured\u000agalaxy velocity fields (or vice versa), using the methods of gravitational\u000ainstability theory, implies that the observed large-scale structures and\u000alarge-scale flows were produced by the action of gravity. This assumption is\u000afalse, in that there exist non-gravitational theories that pass the\u000areconstruction tests and gravitational theories with certain forms of biased\u000agalaxy formation that fail them. Gravitational instability theory predicts\u000aspecific correlations between large-scale velocity and mass density fields, but\u000athe same correlations arise in any model where (a) structures in the galaxy\u000adistribution grow from homogeneous initial conditions in a way that satisfies\u000athe continuity equation, and (b) the present-day velocity field is irrotational\u000aand proportional to the time-averaged velocity field. We demonstrate these\u000aassertions using analytical arguments and N-body simulations of gravitational\u000aand non-gravitational models. We also show examples of gravitational and\u000anon-gravitational models that {\u005cit fail} reconstruction tests because galaxy\u000aformation is modulated (``biased'') in a way that violates the continuity\u000aequation. We discuss the relation between the value of $\u005cOmega$ inferred from\u000avelocity-density comparisons and the true cosmological value.\u000a

V  The string equations of motion and constraints are solved for a ring shaped\u000aAnsatz in cosmological and black hole spacetimes. In FRW universes with\u000aarbitrary power behavior [$R(X^0) = a\u005c;|X^0|^{\u005ca}\u005c, $], the asymptotic form of\u000athe solution is found for both $X^0 \u005cto 0$ and $X^0 \u005cto \u005cinfty$ and we plot the\u000anumerical solution for all times. Right after the big bang ($X^0 = 0$), the\u000astring energy decreasess as $ R(X^0)^{-1} $ and the string size grows as $\u000aR(X^0) $ for $ 0 < \u005ca < 1 $ and as $ X^0 $ for $ \u005ca < 0 $ and $ \u005ca > 1 $. Very\u000asoon [ $ X^0 \u005csim 1 $] , the ring reaches its oscillatory regime with frequency\u000aequal to the winding and constant size and energy. This picture holds for all\u000avalues of $ \u005ca $ including string vacua (for which, asymptotically, $ \u005ca = 1$).\u000aIn addition, an exact non-oscillatory ring solution is found. For black hole\u000aspacetimes (Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\u005coo m and stringy), we solve for\u000aring strings moving towards the center. Depending on their initial conditions\u000a(essentially the oscillation phase), they are are absorbed or not by\u000aSchwarzschild black holes. The phenomenon of particle transmutation is\u000aexplicitly observed (for rings not swallowed by the hole). An effective horizon\u000ais noticed for the rings. Exact and explicit ring solutions inside the\u000ahorizon(s) are found. They may be interpreted as strings propagating between\u000athe different universes described by the full black hole manifold.\u000a

V  The different dynamical processes (relaxation, dynamical friction, tides and\u000amergers) operating in groups and clusters are reviewed. The small-scale\u000asubstructure observed in clusters is argued to be the remnants of the cores of\u000arich clusters that merged together, rather than large groups falling into the\u000acluster. The {\u005csl ROSAT\u005c/} X-ray observations of two groups of galaxies are\u000adiscussed, and, contrary to a previous claim, the baryon fraction is high,\u000arelative to the constraints from baryonic nucleosynthesis. A general theory of\u000athe fundamental surface of groups is presented, allowing one to determine with\u000areasonable confidence the precise cosmo-dynamical state of a given group of\u000agalaxies. The data from groups is then consistent with a universal true $M/L$\u000aof $440\u005c,h$, roughly 4 times larger than previous estimates, the discrepancy\u000aoccurring because most groups are still relatively near cosmological\u000aturnaround. This high $M/L$ and the young cosmo-dynamical state of groups\u000asuggests a density parameter $\u005cOmega > 0.3$. Hickson's compact groups are\u000aexplained as a mixture of virialized groups, loose groups near full collapse,\u000aand chance alignments from collapsing loose groups. Finally, the level of\u000aprojection effects contaminating samples of binary galaxies within groups is\u000ashown to be important.\u000a

Recent mathematical results\u000aprecisely define the conditions for invariance show that this model does not\u000aapply in general. In particular, a slowly varying perturbation may cause\u000asignificant evolution stellar dynamical systems even if its time scale is\u000alonger than any internal orbital time scale. This additional `heating' may have\u000aserious implications for the evolution of star clusters and dwarf galaxies\u000awhich are subject to long-term environmental forces. The mathematical\u000adevelopments leading to these results are reviewed, and the conditions for\u000aapplicability to and further implications for stellar systems are discussed.\u000aCompanion papers present a computational method for a general time-dependent\u000adisturbance and detailed example.\u000a

V  We have used 3-D smoothed particle hydrodynamical simulations to study the\u000abasic properties of the outflow that is created by a protostellar jet in a\u000adense molecular cloud. The dynamics of the jet/cloud interaction is strongly\u000aaffected by the cooling in the shocked gas behind the bow shock at the head of\u000athe jet. We show that this cooling is very rapid, with the cooling distance of\u000athe gas much less than the jet radius. Thus, although ambient gas is initially\u000adriven away from the jet axis by the high thermal pressure odf the post-shock\u000agas, rapid cooling reduces the pressure and the outflow subsequently evolves in\u000aa momentum-conserving snowplow fashion. The velocity of the ambient gas is high\u000ain the vicinity of the jet head, but decreases rapidly as more material is\u000aswept up. Thus, this type of outflow produces extremely high velocity clumps of\u000apost shock gas which resemble the features seen in outflows. We have\u000ainvestigated the transfer of momentum from the jet to the ambient medium as a\u000afunction of the jet parameters. We show that a low Mach number (<6) jet slows\u000adown rapidly because it entrains ambient material along its sides. On the other\u000ahand, the beam of a high Mach number jet is separated from the ambient gas by a\u000alow density cocoon of post-shock gas, and this jet transfers momentum to the\u000aambient medium principally at the bow-shock. In high Mach number jets, as those\u000afrom young stellar objects, the dominant interaction is therefore at the bow\u000ashock at the head of the jet.\u000a

V  We discuss here what model independent information about properties of\u000aneutrinos and of the sun can be obtained from future solar neutrino experiments\u000a(SNO, Super-Kamiokande). It is shown that in the general case of transitions of\u000asolar $\u005cnu_e$'s into $\u005cnu_\u005cmu$ and/or $\u005cnu_\u005ctau$ the initial $^8\u005cmathrm{B}$\u000aneutrino flux can be measured by the observation of NC events. From the CC\u000ameasurements the $\u005cnu_e$ survival probability can be determined as a function\u000aof neutrino energy. The general case of transitions of solar $\u005cnu_e$'s into\u000aactive as well as sterile neutrinos is considered. A number of relations\u000abetween measurable quantities the test of which will allow to answer the\u000aquestion whether there are sterile neutrinos in the solar neutrino flux on the\u000aearth are derived. Transitions of solar $\u005cnu_e$'s into active and sterile\u000astates due to neutrino mixing and Dirac magnetic moments or into active\u000aleft-handed neutrinos and active right-handed antineutrinos due to neutrino\u000amixing and Majorana transition magnetic moments are also considered. It is\u000ashown that future solar neutrino experiments will allow to distinguish between\u000athe cases of Dirac and Majorana magnetic moments.\u000a

The application of these\u000aquantities to ``detect'' clusters is discussed. For the scaling laws which hold\u000ain hierarchical clustering models (void scaling, combinant scaling) a\u000ageneralization is provided. It is shown that testing hierarchical models is\u000ameaningful only for phase-space volumes not larger than the characteristic\u000acorrelation length introduced by Poisson superposition.

V  Flat and open universe models are considered, containing a mixture of cold\u000amatter (dust) and radiation interacting only through gravity, with the aim of\u000astudying their stability with respect to linear scalar perturbations. To this\u000aend the perturbed universe is considered as a dynamical system, described by\u000acoupled differential equations for a gauge\u005chs invariant perturbation variable\u000aand a relevant background variable. The phase\u005chs space analysis of this\u000adynamical system shows that flat dust\u005chs radiation models are unstable, and\u000aopen models structurally unstable, with respect to adiabatic perturbations. It\u000ais shown that there are perturbations which decay even if their wavelength at\u000aequidensity is larger than the corresponding Jeans scale. Metric and curvature\u000aperturbations are also briefly discussed. We believe that this analysis gives a\u000aclearer idea of the stability properties of realistic universe models than the\u000astandard one based on the Jeans scale, despite our simplifying assumptions.\u000a

V  We construct models of the inner part of a transonic adiabatic accretion disc\u000aassuming constant specific angular momentum taking the vertical structure fully\u000ainto account.\u005c\u005c For comparison purposes, we construct the corresponding one\u000adimensional viscous disc models derived under vertical averaging assumptions.\u000aThe conditions under which a unique location for the critical/sonic point is\u000aobtained, given an appropriate set of exterior boundary conditions for these\u000amodels, is also discussed. This is not unique if the standard '$\u005calpha $'\u000aprescription with viscous stress proportional to the angular velocity gradient\u000ais used.\u005c\u005c We use a simple model to discuss the possible limitations on the\u000aform of the viscous stress arising from the requirement that viscous\u000ainformation must travel at a finite speed. Contrary to results in the existing\u000aliterature, the viscous stress tends to be {\u005cit increased} rather than reduced\u000afor the type of flows we consider in which the angular momentum and angular\u000avelocity gradients have opposite signs. However, finite propagation effects may\u000aresult in a unique location for the sonic point.\u005c\u005c We found good agreement\u000abetween the radial flow and specific angular momentum profiles in the inner\u000aregions of the one dimensional models and those in the equatorial plane for\u000acorresponding two dimensional models which may be matched for a range of\u000a$\u005calpha $ between 0.1 and 10$^{-4}$.\u000a

V  Many analyses of microwave background experiments neglect the correlation of\u000anoise in different frequency or polarization channels. We show that these\u000acorrelations, should they be present, can lead to severe misinterpretation of\u000aan experiment. In particular, correlated noise arising from either electronics\u000aor atmosphere may mimic a cosmic signal. We quantify how the likelihood\u000afunction for a given experiment varies with noise correlation, using both\u000asimple analytic models and actual data. For a typical microwave background\u000aanisotropy experiment, noise correlations at the level of 1\u005c% of the overall\u000anoise can seriously {\u005cit reduce} the significance of a given detection.\u000a

V  In this paper we discuss four early F-type variable stars whose periods are\u000aan order of magnitude slower than known pulsators of comparable luminosity.\u000aThey cannot be stars undergoing simple radial pulsations. For one or more of\u000athese stars we can discount the possibility that the variability is due to\u000arotational modulation of star spots, interactions with (or tidal distortions\u000aby) a close companion, or obscuration by a rotating lumpy ring of dust orbiting\u000athe star. They are certainly not eclipsing binaries. The only possibility left\u000aseems to be non-radial pulsations, though this explanation involves\u000adifficulties of its own. If they are indeed pulsating stars exhibiting non-\u000aradial gravity modes, they would be the first stars on the cool side of the\u000aCepheid instability strip in the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram to be so\u000aidentified.\u000a

We evaluate the compactness of the $\u005csim$10\u005cm\u005c emission of galaxy\u000anuclei by comparing these small-beam measures with the large-beam IRAS 12\u005cm\u005c\u000afluxes. In the analysis of different subsets of objects, we apply survival\u000aanalysis techniques in order to exploit the information contained in\u000a``censored'' data (i.e., upper limits on the fluxes). Seyferts are found to\u000acontain the most powerful nuclear sources of mid-infrared emission, which in\u000a$\u005csim$1/3 of cases provide the bulk of the emission of the entire galaxy; thus,\u000amid-infrared emission in the outer disc regions is not uncommon in Seyferts.\u000aThe 10\u005cm\u005c emission of Seyferts appears to be unrelated to their X-ray emission.\u000aHII region-like nuclei are stronger mid-infrared sources than normal nuclei and\u000aLINER nuclei (whose level of emission is not distinguishable from that of\u000anormal nuclei). Interacting objects have, on average, greater 10\u005cm\u005c\u000aluminosities than non-interacting ones and exhibit more compact emission.\u000aEarly-type spirals have stronger and more compact 10\u005cm\u005c emission than late-type\u000aones. Barred spirals are brighter at $\u005csim$10\u005cm\u005c than unbarred systems,\u000aessentially because they more frequently contain HII region-like nuclei. The\u000aresults of our detailed comparison between the behaviour of various categories\u000aof objects stress that the 10\u005cm\u005c emission of spiral nuclei is closely linked to\u000athe (predominantly non-thermal synchrotron) radio\u000a

V  Galactic halo neutralinos ($\u005cchi$) captured by the Sun or Earth produce\u000ahigh-energy neutrinos as end-products of various annihilation modes. These\u000aneutrinos can travel from the Sun or Earth cores to the neighborhood of\u000aunderground detectors (``neutrino telescopes") where they can interact and\u000aproduce upwardly-moving muons. We compute these muon fluxes in the context of\u000athe minimal $SU(5)$ supergravity model, and the no-scale and dilaton\u000a$SU(5)\u005ctimes U(1)$ supergravity models. At present, with the Kamiokande 90\u005c%\u000aC.L. upper limits on the flux, only a small fraction of the parameter space of\u000athe $SU(5)\u005ctimes U(1)$ models is accessible for $m_\u005cchi\u005csim m_{\u005crm Fe}$, which\u000ain turn implies constraints for the lightest chargino mass around 100 GeV for a\u000arange of $\u005ctan\u005cbeta$ values. We also delineate the regions of parameter space\u000athat would be accessible with the improvements of experimental sensitivity\u000aexpected in the near future at Gran Sasso, Super-Kamiokande, and other\u000afacilities such as DUMAND and AMANDA, currently under construction. We conclude\u000athat if neutralinos are present in the halo, then this technique can be used to\u000aeventually explore more than half of the allowed parameter space of these\u000aspecific models, and more generally of a large class of supergravity models, in\u000amany ways surpassing the reach of traditional collider experiments.\u000a

Under a variety of\u000aionization conditions and in systems with or without non-baryonic components,\u000athe baryons lose angular momentum efficiently and collapse to form a compact\u000aoptically--thick object which would probably quickly evolve into a massive\u000ablack hole. Attention is concentrated on elucidating some of the novel physical\u000aeffects in early cosmological collapses, but ways in which more realistic\u000acalculations might be made and in which the scenario could be incorporated into\u000aa more complete cosmogonic model are discussed.\u000a

V  When a galaxy forms, the disk may initially be tilted with respect to a\u000aflattened dark halo. The misalignment between the disk and the halo is a common\u000aexplanation for galactic disk warps, since in this state, disks have precessing\u000abending modes which resemble real warps. A dubious assumption in this theory is\u000athat the gravitational response of the halo is negligible. We therefore\u000acalculate the response of an oblate halo to a precessing inclined exponential\u000adisk using a variety of techniques. We construct models with a rigid\u000aexponential disk precessing in a particle halo, a particle disk precessing\u000ainside a static bulge/halo potential, and a self-consistent model with a\u000aparticle disk, bulge and halo. When the disk:halo mass ratio is small\u000a($\u005csim$10\u005c%) within 5 exponential scale radii, the disk settles to the\u000aequatorial plane of the halo within 5 orbital times. When the disk and halo\u000amass are comparable, the halo rapidly aligns with the disk within a few orbital\u000atimes, while the disk inclination drops. The rapid response of the halo to a\u000ainclined disk suggests that the warps seen in galactic disks are not likely the\u000abending modes of a precessing disk inside of triaxial halos. If a galaxy forms\u000ainclined to the principal plane of a dark halo, either the disk will settle to\u000aa principal plane or the inner halo will twist to align with the disk. The\u000aouter halo will remain misaligned for a much longer time and therefore may\u000astill exert a torque. Warped bending modes may still exist if the misalignment\u000aof the outer halo persists for a Hubble time.\u000a

V  We propose that the recently reported MACHO/EROS events correspond to\u000agravitational amplification by dark clouds rather than compact objects. These\u000aclouds must be very dense with $M\u005csim 0.1 ~M_\u005codot$ and $R\u005cla 10^{14}~{\u005crm\u000acm}$. In all likelihood, the clouds will be members of a family of objects with\u000adifferent sizes and masses. We therefore expect events of longer duration than\u000athe ones reported by the MACHO and EROS groups but with light curves very\u000adifferent from the ones derived assuming point mass lenses. We suggest that one\u000asuch event has already been observed in radio measurements of the quasar\u000a1502+106. The abundances of free electrons, metals, complex molecules, and dust\u000agrains are constrained to be very small suggesting that the clouds are formed\u000afrom a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium. Cosmic rays and background UV\u000aradiation ionize a halo around the cloud. Radio waves from distant sources will\u000abe scattered by the electrons in this halo, an effect which may have already\u000abeen observed in quasars such as 1502+106. We argue that dark clouds are a\u000aviable alternative to compact objects for baryonic dark matter in the halo.\u000a

This\u000aasymmetry, in spite of the galaxy's face-on orientation and the symmetric bar\u000astruct ure in the CO-line emission, indicates that the dark lane is an\u000aoff-plane structure.

V  Walraven photometry of established and probable members of the Orion OB1\u000aassociation is presented. Effective temperature, surface gravity, luminosity\u000aand mass are derived for all stars, using atmosphere models by Kurucz (1979).\u000aAbsolute magnitudes are calculated using the Straizys and Kuriliene (1981)\u000atables. Distance moduli and visual extinctions are determined. A comparison of\u000athe visual extinctions to IRAS $100\u005cum$ data shows that the near edge of the\u000aOrion A and B clouds lies at a distance of $\u005csim 320\u005cpc$, while the far edge is\u000aat $\u005csim 500\u005cpc$. A method for deriving the ages of the subgroups by comparing\u000atheoretical isochrones to the observations in the log g, log T plane is\u000apresented. The derived ages suggest, contrary to earlier studies, that subgroup\u000a1b is younger than 1c, which can possibly be explained by past geometries of\u000athe system of stars and gas. The initial mass function for Orion OB1 is derived\u000awith the aid of the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test. Through extensive simulations, we\u000ashow that it is very difficult to derive accurately the IMF from the available\u000adata. To within somewhat weak limits the IMF is found to be of the form $\u005cxi\u000a(\u005clog M)=AM^{-1.7\u005cpm 0.2}$ for all subgroups. The energy output of the\u000asubgroups in the form of stellar winds and supernovae is calculated and\u000acompared to the observed size and expansion velocity of the Orion-Eridanus\u000abubble. It is shown that the energy output of the association can account for\u000athe morphology and kinematics of the ISM.\u000a

V  We present a study of the ionization and thermal structure of neutral\u000ahydrogen clouds located in the Galactic halo, immersed in the extragalactic\u000abackground radiation field, and supposed to be in pressure equilibrium with the\u000asurrounding (presumably) hot medium. The problem is solved numerically, but an\u000auseful analytical approximation has been derived as well. We discuss the two\u000amain parameters of the problem, \u005cie the radiation field and the halo pressure,\u000ain the framework of the current models for the halo/disk interaction. We find a\u000awell defined relation between a critical column density at which the cloud\u000astarts to develop a cold central core with the cloud linear size. Making use of\u000athis relation, we suggest a straightforward method to derive the distance to\u000athe cloud. We discuss the possible sources of error in this determination and\u000ait is found that the method is particularly suitable for those clouds which are\u000asubsonic with respect to the surrounding medium, while for the supersonic ones,\u000athe method can only give a lower limit to the distance. The H$\u005calpha$ emission\u000afrom the partially ionized edge of the cloud is calculated and compared with\u000athe available observations; this measure is a powerful indicator of the\u000apossible presence of a shock in the cloud.\u000a

V  Following the discovery by Quashnock and Lamb (1993) of an apparent excess of\u000a$\u005cgamma$-ray burst pairs with small angular separations, we reanalyze the\u000aangular distribution of the bursts in the BATSE catalogue. We find that in\u000aaddition to an excess of close pairs, there is also a comparable excess of\u000aantipodal bursts, i.e pairs of bursts separated by about 180 degrees in the\u000asky. Both excesses have only modest statistical significance. We reject the\u000ahypothesis put forward by Quashnock and Lamb that burst sources are repeaters,\u000asince it is obvious that this hypothesis does not predict an excess of\u000aantipodal coincidences. Lacking any physical model of bursts that can explain\u000athe antipodal pairs, we suggest that the two excesses seen in the data are\u000aeither due to an unusual statistical fluctuation or caused by some unknown\u000aselection effect.\u000a

V  Hierarchical gravitational clustering creates galaxies that usually do not\u000afully share the dynamical history of an average particle in the mass field. In\u000aparticular, galaxy tracers identified in numerical simulations can have\u000aindividual velocity dispersions in virialized regions a factor \u005cbvs\u005c lower than\u000athe dark matter. The field average of the pairwise velocity dispersion depends\u000aon the statistical weighting of collapsed regions, so that the tracer pairwise\u000adispersion is a different factor, \u005cbvp, times the density field value. A model\u000aof a cool equilibrium tracer population demonstrates that mass to light\u000asegregation is very sensitive to single particle velocity bias. For the\u000a$\u005cphi=-GM/(r+a)$ potential a $\u005cbvs=0.9$ tracer indicates a virial mass about a\u000afactor of 5 low. The likely value of \u005cbvs\u005c is estimated and the simple\u000aequilibrium model is tested for applicability using a $10^6$ particle\u000asimulation of the formation of a single cluster from cosmological initial\u000aconditions. From this simulation, the value of \u005cbvs\u005c is estimated as\u000a$0.8\u005cpm0.1$. The pairwise velocity dispersion bias, \u005cbvp, which is equal to\u000a\u005cbvs\u005c augmented with any anti-bias of galaxies against high velocity dispersion\u000aclusters. The value of \u005cbvp\u005c is estimated to be 15\u005c% less than \u005cbvs,\u000aconsequently $\u005cbvp=0.6^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$. Comparison of cluster mass and\u000aluminosity profiles at large radii is a test for the existence of single\u000aparticle velocity bias.

This is\u000amost easily explained if at large scales there is no significant biasing\u000abetween matter and galaxy fluctuations.

V  We demonstrate that our Galactic Center, despite little evidence for the\u000apresence of a currently active nucleus, provides insight into the feeding of\u000aAGN: The observed velocity field of molecular clouds can be interpreted as\u000atracing out the spiralling inwards of gas in a large accretion flow towards the\u000aGalactic Center (Linden et al. 1993, Biermann et al. 1993) in the radial\u000adistance range from a few parsec to a few hundred pc. The required effective\u000aviscosity corresponds well to the observed turbulent velocities and\u000acharacteristic length scales. The implied mass influx provides indeed all the\u000amaterial needed to maintain the presently observed star formation rate at\u000adistances closer than about $100$ pc. We argue that the energy input from\u000asupernova explosions due to the high rate of star formation can feed the\u000aturbulence of the interstellar medium. This then keeps the effective viscosity\u000ahigh as required to feed the star formation. We suggest that this process leads\u000ato limit cycles in star formation, and as a consequence also to limit cycles in\u000athe feeding of any activity at the very center.\u000a

V  The Eulerian cosmological fluid equations are used to study the nonlinear\u000amode coupling of density fluctuations. We evaluate the second-order power\u000aspectrum including all four-point contributions. In the weakly nonlinear regime\u000awe find that the dominant nonlinear contribution for realistic cosmological\u000aspectra is made by the coupling of long-wave modes and is well estimated by\u000asecond order perturbation theory. For a linear spectrum like that of the cold\u000adark matter model, second order effects cause a significant enhancement of the\u000ahigh $k$ part of the spectrum and a slight suppression at low $k$ near the peak\u000aof the spectrum. Our perturbative results agree well in the quasilinear regime\u000awith the nonlinear spectrum from high-resolution N-body simulations.\u000a  We find that due to the long-wave mode coupling, characteristic nonlinear\u000amasses grow less slowly in time (i.e., are larger at higher redshifts) than\u000awould be estimated using the linear power spectrum. For the cold dark matter\u000amodel at $(1+z)=(20,10,5,2)$ the nonlinear mass is about $(180,8,2.5,1.6)$\u000atimes (respectively) larger than a linear extrapolation would indicate, if the\u000acondition rms $\u005cdelta\u005crho/\u005crho =1$ is used to define the nonlinear scale. At\u000ahigh redshift the Press-Schechter mass distribution significantly\u000aunderestimates the abundance of high-mass objects for the cold dark matter\u000amodel. Although the quantitative results depend on the definition of the\u000anonlinear scale, these basic consequences hold for any initial spectrum whose\u000apost-recombination spectral index $n$ decreases sufficiently rapidly with\u000aincreasing $k$, a feature which arises quite generally during the transition\u000afrom a radiation- to matter-dominated universe.\u000a

V  We propose a novel method for the description of spatial patterns formed by a\u000acoverage of point sets representing galaxy samples. This method is based on a\u000acomplete family of morphological measures known as Minkowski functionals, which\u000aincludes the topological Euler characteristic and geometric descriptors to\u000aspecify the content, shape and connectivity of spatial sets. The method is\u000anumerically robust even for small samples, independent of statistical\u000aassumptions, and yields global as well as local morphological information. We\u000aillustrate the method by applying it to a Poisson process, a `double-Poisson'\u000aprocess, and to the Abell catalogue of galaxy clusters.\u000a

V  Fluids suspended in expanding laboratory systems cavitate into Voronoi foams\u000athat degenerate through secondary cavitation of the foam walls. This robust\u000amorphological mechanism results from a virtual competition for space between\u000athe cavities. In cosmology, Voronoi foams are known to explain important\u000afeatures of the large scale structure, but the physical mechanism for the\u000aformation of such foams is unknown. We here present a scenario for the\u000aformation of large scale structure: Cavitation initiates at the abrupt\u000areduction of radiation pressure on matter at decoupling and results in the cold\u000aflow of matter into a single, void-dominated structure with a scale determined\u000aby the Hubble sphere at decoupling. This mechanism does not impose restrictions\u000aon the smoothness of the last scattering surface at decoupling and conserves\u000athe entropy of matter during the self-organization of a single cavitation foam\u000aspanning the observable universe.\u000a

V  We present explicit expressions for the calculation of cosmological look back\u000atime, for zero cosmological constant and arbitrary density parameter $\u005cOmega$,\u000awhich, in the limit as redshift becomes infinite, give the age of the universe.\u000aThe case for non-zero cosmological constant is most easily solved via numerical\u000aintegration. The most distant objects presently known (approaching redshift z =\u000a5) have implied ages of $\u005capprox$ 1-2 Gyr after the the Big Bang. The range of\u000asuch age is narrow, in spite of a variety of cosmological models one might\u000achoose. We give a graphical representation of a variety of cosmological models\u000aand show that a wide range of Hubble constants and values of the age and\u000adensity of the universe compatible with modern studies are consistent with\u000aadoption of a positive cosmological constant.\u000a

V  We use the analytical model recently introduced in Ref. \u005ccite{lp92}, to\u000ainvestigate the statistics of temperature fluctuations on the cosmic microwave\u000abackground (CMB), induced by topological defects. The cases of cosmic strings\u000aand textures are studied. We derive analytically the characteristic function of\u000athe probability distribution for ${\u005cdelta T}\u005cover T$ and use it to obtain the\u000alowest twelve moments including the skewness and the kurtosis. The distribution\u000afunction is also obtained and it is compared with the Gaussian distribution\u000athus identifying long non-Gaussian tails. We show that for both cosmic strings\u000aand textures all odd moments (including skewness) vanish while the relative\u000adeviation from the Gaussian for even moments increases with the order of the\u000amoment. The non-Gaussian signatures of textures, derived from the distribution\u000afunction and the moments, are found to be much more prominent than the\u000acorresponding signatures for strings. We discuss the physical origin of this\u000aresult.\u000a

V  We investigate the role of nuclear spin in elastic scattering of Dark Matter\u000a(DM) neutralinos from nuclei in the framework of the Minimal SUSY standard\u000amodel (MSSM). The relative contribution of spin-dependent axial-vector and\u000aspin-independent scalar interactions to the event rate in a DM detector has\u000abeen analyzed for various nuclei. Within general assumptions about the nuclear\u000aand nucleon structure we find that for nuclei with atomic weights $A > 50$ the\u000aspin-independent part of the event rate $R_{si}$ is larger than the\u000aspin-dependent one $R_{sd}$ in the domain of the MSSM parameter space allowed\u000aby the known experimental data and where the additional constraint for the\u000atotal event rate $R =R_{sd} + R_{si} > 0.01$ is satisfied. The latter reflects\u000arealistic sensitivities of present and near future DM detectors. Therefore we\u000aexpect equal chances for discovering the DM event either with spin-zero or with\u000aspin-non-zero isotopes if their atomic weights are $A_{1} \u005csim A_{2} > 50$.\u000a

V  We examine the effect of redshift space distortions on the galaxy two-point\u000acorrelation function $\u005cxi(r_p,\u005cpi)$ as a function of separations parallel\u000a($r_p$) and perpendicular ($\u005cpi$) to the line of sight. We find that the\u000arelative velocity dispersion of pairs of IRAS galaxies is $\u005csigma(r)=\u000a317^{+40}_{-49}$ \u005ckms at $r=1 \u005cmpc$, consistent with previous estimates derived\u000afrom optically selected galaxy catalogues. Unfortunately, the use of this\u000aresult to estimate $\u005cOmega$ via the Cosmic Virial Theorem is thwarted by large\u000asystematic uncertainties. We also fit for the mean relative streaming velocity\u000aof pairs, $v_{12}(r)$, which describes the growth of fluctuations on both\u000alinear and nonlinear scales. We find that $v_{12}(r) = 167^{+99}_{-67}$ \u005ckms at\u000a$r=4$\u005cmpc, so that on average, approximately half the Hubble expansion velocity\u000aof pairs at this separation is canceled by infall. At $r=10$\u005cmpc, the amplitude\u000aof the streaming is lower and $v_{12}(r) = 109^{+64}_{-47} \u005ckms$. Linear\u000aperturbation theory then implies that $\u005cOmega^{0.6}/b =0.45^{+0.27}_{-0.18}$ on\u000ascales $\u005csim 10-15 \u005cmpc$. The amplitude of $v_{12}(r)$ is sensitive to the\u000aassumed shape of $\u005csigma(r)$; if the latter deviates substantially from a\u000avirialized form on small scale, our best fit amplitude of $v_{12}(r)$ can\u000adeviate by a factor of two.\u000a

V  We present the first results from an all-sky maser-line survey of symbiotic\u000aMiras. Interferometric spectral-line observations of R Aqr and H1-36 Arae have\u000arevealed a 22-GHz water maser in the former and 1612-MHz hydroxyl and weak\u000a22-GHz water maser emission from the latter. H1-36 has thus become the first\u000aknown symbiotic OH/IR star. We have also detected weak OH line emission from\u000athe vicinity of R Aqr, but we note that there are small discrepencies between\u000athe OH- and H2O-line velocities and positions. These detections demonstrate\u000aunequivocally that dust can shield some circumstellar hydroxyl and water\u000amolecules from dissociation, even in systems which possess intense local\u000asources of UV. Finally, we discuss some of the implications of these\u000aobservations. The narrow profile of the water maser in R Aqr means that there\u000amay finally be an opportunity to determine the system's orbital parameters. We\u000aalso point out that high resolution synthesis observations may trace the\u000adistribution of dust in H1-36 and R Aqr, possibly throwing light on the\u000amass-loss process in symbiotic Miras and placing constraints on the amount of\u000acollimation experienced by UV radiation from their hot, compact companions.\u000a

V  I review recent work on the radial transport of angular momentum in ionized,\u000aKeplerian accretion disks. Proposed mechanisms include hydrodynamic and MHD\u000alocal instabilities and long range effects mediated by wave transport. The most\u000apromising models incorporate the Velikhov-Chandrasekhar instability, caused by\u000aan instability of the magnetic field embedded in a differentially rotating\u000adisk. This has the important feature that the induced turbulent motions\u000anecessarily transport angular momentum outward. By contrast, convective modes\u000amay transport angular momentum in either direction. Combining the magnetic\u000afield instability with an $\u005calpha-\u005cOmega$ dynamo driven by internal waves leads\u000ato a model in which the dimensionless viscosity scales as $(H/r)^{4/3}$.\u000aHowever, this model has a phenomenology which is quite different from the\u000a$\u005calpha$ disk model. For example, an active disk implies some source of\u000aexcitation for the internal waves. In binary systems with a mass ratio of order\u000aunity the most likely exciting mechanism is a parametric instability due to\u000atidal forces. This implies that in systems where the accretion stream is\u000aintermittent, like MV Lyrae or TT Ari, epochs when the mass flow is absent or\u000avery small will be epochs in which the disk shrinks and becomes relatively\u000ainactive and dark. This model also implies that forced vertical mixing is\u000aimportant, even in convectively stable disks. I discuss various observational\u000atests of this model and the focus of current theoretical work.\u000a

V  These notes form an introduction to cosmology with special emphasis on large\u000ascale structure, the cmb anisotropy and inflation. In some places a basic\u000afamiliarity with particle physics is assumed, but otherwise no special\u000aknowledge is needed. Most of the material in the first two sections can be\u000afound in several texts, except that the discussion of dark matter and the\u000acosmological constant is more up to date. Most of that in the remaining\u000asections can be found in a review of structure formation and inflation done\u000awith Andrew Liddle, which describes original work by various authors including\u000aourselves and Ewan Stewart. The reader is referred to these works for more\u000adetail, and a very complete list of references.\u000a

V  We present new optical and infrared photometric observations and high\u000aresolution H$\u005calpha$ spectra of the periodic radio star \u005clsi. The optical\u000aphotometric data set covers the time interval 1985-1993 and amounts to about a\u000ahundred nights. A period of $\u005csim$26 days is found in the V band. The infrared\u000adata also present evidence for a similar periodicity, but with higher amplitude\u000aof variation (0\u005crmag 2). The spectroscopic observations include 16 intermediate\u000aand high dispersion spectra of \u005clsi\u005c collected between January 1989 and\u000aFebruary 1993. The H$\u005calpha$ emission line profile and its variations are\u000aanalyzed. Several emission line parameters -- among them the H$\u005calpha$ EW and\u000athe width of the H$\u005calpha$ red hump -- change strongly at or close to radio\u000amaximum, and may exhibit periodic variability. We also observe a significant\u000achange in the peak separation. The H$\u005calpha$ profile of \u005clsi\u005c does not seem\u000apeculiar for a Be star. However, several of the observed variations of the\u000aH$\u005calpha$ profile can probably be associated with the presence of the compact,\u000asecondary star.\u000a

V  %The content of this replacement paper is identical to the original. %We have\u000aattempted to fix the postscript so that it will print out on %a larger number\u000aof printers. Using recent experimental limits on $\u005cmu$ distortions from COBE\u000aFIRAS, and the large lever-arm spanning the damping of sub-Jeans scale\u000afluctuations to the scale of the COBE DMR fluctuations, we set a constraint on\u000athe slope of the primordial power spectrum $n$. It is possible to analytically\u000acalculate the contribution over the full range of scales and redshifts,\u000acorrectly taking into account fluctuation growth and damping as well as\u000athermalization processes. We find that the 95\u005c% upper limit is weakly dependent\u000aon cosmological parameters, e.g. $n<1.54 (h=0.5)$ and $n<1.56 (h=1.0)$ for\u000a$\u005cOmega_0=1$ with marginally weaker constraints for $\u005cOmega_0<1$ in a flat\u000a$\u005cOmega_0 +\u005cOmega_\u005cLambda=1$ universe.\u000a

For a specific choice of\u000ascalar potential which occurs in models of so called late-time phase\u000atransitions in which domain walls are produced, $\u005cpp$ is shown to evolve from a\u000aGaussian to a non-Gaussian distribution.

V  Point particles fall freely along geodesics; strings do not. In string theory\u000aall probes of spacetime structure, including photons, are extended objects and\u000atherefore always subject to tidal forces. We illustrate how string theory\u000amodifies the behavior of light in weak gravitational fields and limits the\u000aapplicability of the principle of equivalence. This gives in principle a window\u000aon the short-distance structure of geometry in quantum gravity where one can\u000asee in a model-independent way how some of its predictions differ from those of\u000aclassical gravity. We compare this with the lessons of high-energy string\u000ascattering.\u000a

V  The edge-on Sc galaxy NGC 5907 has been observed in the 12CO(1-0)-line\u000aemission using the Nobeyama 45-m telescope. The radial density distribution\u000abetween 2 and 13 kpc is well represented by a superposition of an\u000aexponential-law disk of scale radius 3.5 kpc and a ring of 7 kpc radius.\u000aHowever, no concentration of gas has been observed in the central 2 kpc. The\u000aradial distribution and position-velocity diagram are compared in detail with\u000athose obtained for HI. We found that the molecular gas dominates in the central\u000a5 kpc region, while HI does in the outer region, clearly separated by a\u000a``molecular front'' at 5 kpc radius. This molecular front will be the place\u000awhere the phase change from HI to molecular hydrogen, or vice versa, is taking\u000aplace in a galactic scale. The central deficiency of the molecular gas is\u000aexceptional for a late type galaxy, which was found for the first time among Sc\u000agalaxies, and the second case after the Sb galaxy M31. We argue for the\u000apossibility of destruction of the nuclear gas disk by a merger of another\u000agalaxy, and discuss its relation to the outer warping disk.\u000a

V  The formation of the resonance lines of neutral boron in solar-type stellar\u000aatmospheres is investigated taking into account effects of departures from\u000alocal thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE effects). The latter are due to a\u000acombination of overionisation and optical pumping in resonance lines, both\u000acaused by the hot, non-local, ultraviolet radiation fields in the line-forming\u000aregions. They lead to an underestimation of the boron abundance when analysis\u000amethods assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) are used. The abundance\u000acorrection, for the 249.7~nm resonance line, amounts to $+$0.6 dex for the\u000ametal-poor star HD140283 and $+$0.4 dex for Procyon. No significant NLTE\u000aeffects are predicted for the Sun. Applying the abundance correction on the\u000aresults for HD140283 of Duncan et al. (1992) leads to a B/Be ratio well above\u000athe minimum value required by spallation production of beryllium. The\u000areliability of the results in view of atomic and atmospheric uncertainties is\u000adiscussed. With the possible exception of photospheric inhomogeneity, it seems\u000aunlikely that these could remove the effect for HD140283.\u000a

V  The MS1224+20 cluster of galaxies is a high luminosity X-ray source at\u000az=0.325. To compare the lensing mass to the virial mass we have completed a\u000auniform, high precision redshift survey over a field of $7\u005carcm\u005ctimes9\u005carcm$,\u000aobtaining 75 redshifts. The velocity dispersion of 30 cluster galaxies is $775$\u000a\u005ckms\u005c and the projected harmonic radius is 0.32 \u005chmpc. The virial mass is\u000a$2.1\u005ctimes 10^{14} h^{-1} \u005cmsun$. Correcting for faint cluster galaxies without\u000aredshifts and allowing for a modest evolution in the galaxy luminosity function\u000agives a current epoch mass-to-light ratio $M/L_V(0)=255h \u005cmsun/\u005clsun$. The same\u000afield contains a $z=0.225$ cluster with $\u005csigma_v\u005csimeq 500$ \u005ckms, and a group\u000aat $z=0.412$ with $\u005csigma_v\u005csimeq 400$ \u005ckms. The clusters' gravitational field\u000ainduces image ellipticities that are calculated from the light-traces-mass\u000adensity distribution and compared to the observed average tangential\u000adistortions from Fahlman \u005cet (1994). Between 1.5 and 3 virial radii, the\u000aobserved lensing distortions are $4\u005cpm2$ times stronger than the\u000alight-traces-mass model and the virial M/L predict.\u000a

We show that, if the dilaton potential has certain generic\u000aproperties, the two branches can evolve smoothly into each other. We find,\u000ahowever, that just the effects of a potential do not allow for a graceful exit\u000afrom accelerated inflation in the weak curvature regime.

V  We solve the nonlinear evolution of pressureless, irrotational density\u000afluctuations in a perturbed Robertson-Walker spacetime using a new Lagrangian\u000amethod based on the velocity gradient and gravity gradient tensors. Borrowing\u000aresults from general relativity, we obtain a set of Newtonian ordinary\u000adifferential equations for these quantities following a given mass element.\u000aUsing these Lagrangian fluid equations we prove the following results: (1) The\u000aspherical tophat perturbation, having zero shear, is the slowest configuration\u000ato collapse for a given initial density and growth rate. (2) Initial density\u000amaxima are not generally the sites where collapse first occurs. (3) Initially\u000aunderdense regions may undergo collapse if the shear is not too small. If the\u000amagnetic part of the Weyl tensor vanishes, the nonlinear evolution is described\u000apurely locally by our equations; this condition holds for spherical,\u000acylindrical, and planar perturbations and may be a good approximation in other\u000acircumstances. Assuming the vanishing of the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor,\u000awe compute the exact nonlinear gravitational evolution of cold matter. We find\u000athat 56\u005c% of initially underdense regions collapse in an Einstein-de Sitter\u000auniverse for a homogeneous and isotropic random field. We also show that, given\u000athis assumption, the final stage of collapse is generically two-dimensional,\u000aleading to strongly prolate filaments rather than Zel'dovich pancakes. While\u000athis result may explain the prevalence of filamentary collapses in N-body\u000asimulations, it is not true in general, suggesting that the magnetic part of\u000athe Weyl tensor need not vanish in the Newtonian limit.\u000a

V  It is argued that the observed Thermodynamic Arrow of Time must arise from\u000athe boundary conditions of the universe. We analyse the consequences of the no\u000aboundary proposal, the only reasonably complete set of boundary conditions that\u000ahas been put forward. We study perturbations of a Friedmann model containing a\u000amassive scalar field but our results should be independent of the details of\u000athe matter content. We find that gravitational wave perturbations have an\u000aamplitude that remains in the linear regime at all times and is roughly time\u000asymmetric about the time of maximum expansion. Thus gravitational wave\u000aperturbations do not give rise to an Arrow of Time. However density\u000aperturbations behave very differently. They are small at one end of the\u000auniverse's history, but grow larger and become non linear as the universe gets\u000alarger. Contrary to an earlier claim, the density perturbations do not get\u000asmall again at the other end of the universe's history. They therefore give\u000arise to a Thermodynamic Arrow of Time that points in a constant direction while\u000athe universe expands and contracts again. The Arrow of Time does not reverse at\u000athe point of maximum expansion. One has to appeal to the Weak Anthropic\u000aPrinciple to explain why we observe the Thermodynamic Arrow to agree with the\u000aCosmological Arrow, the direction of time in which the universe is expanding.\u000a

Beginning with\u000atwo-dimensional gravitational clustering simulations smoothed to the threshold\u000aof nonlinearity, we perform percolation analysis to determine the large scale\u000astructure. The resulting objective definition of voids has a natural scaling\u000aproperty, is topologically interesting, and can be applied immediately to\u000aredshift surveys.\u000a

V  We investigate the sensitivity of individual LIGO/VIRGO-like interferometers\u000aand the precision with which they can determine the characteristics of an\u000ainspiralling binary system. Since the two interferometers of the LIGO detector\u000ashare nearly the same orientation, their joint sensitivity is similar to that\u000aof a single, more sensitive interferometer. We express our results for a single\u000ainterferometer of both initial and advanced LIGO design, and also for the LIGO\u000adetector in the limit that its two interferometers share exactly the same\u000aorientation. We approximate the evolution of a binary system as driven\u000aexclusively by leading order quadrupole gravitational radiation. To assess the\u000asensitivity, we calculate the rate at which sources are expected to be\u000aobserved, the range to which they are observable, and the precision with which\u000acharacteristic quantities describing the observed binary system can be\u000adetermined. Assuming a conservative rate density for coalescing neutron star\u000abinary systems we expect that the advanced LIGO detector will observe\u000aapproximately 69~yr${}^{-1}$ with an amplitude SNR greater than 8. Of these,\u000aapproximately 7~yr${}^{-1}$ will be from binaries at distances greater than\u000a950~Mpc. We explore the sensitivity of these results to a tunable parameter in\u000athe interferometer design (the recycling frequency). The optimum choice of the\u000aparameter is dependent on the goal of the observations, e.g., maximizing the\u000arate of detections or maximizing the precision of measurement. We determine the\u000aoptimum parameter values for these two cases.\u000a

V  Gas cloud models taking into account the recently disclosed fractal structure\u000aof cold gas are set up, showing that large errors in the classical gas mass\u000adetermination based on smooth cloud models can easily follow if the gas is in\u000areality fractal. Fractal clouds must present both optically thin and optically\u000athick clumps in any single wavelength observations. The observed fractal\u000adimension of the cold ISM suggests that mass underestimates by a factor 10 or\u000amore are typical. Due to its low temperature (around 3 K), and its condensed\u000afractal structure, together with its low metallicity, the outer gas would be\u000aalmost invisible for usual detectors.

V  We have examined the effect of the environmental density on the arm\u000aclassification of an extensive sample of spiral galaxies included in the Nearby\u000aGalaxy Catalog (Tully, 1988a). We have also explored the dependence of the arm\u000aclass of a galaxy on other factors, such as its blue absolute magnitude and its\u000adisk-to-total mass ratio, inferred in the literature either from the gradient\u000aof a good galaxy rotation curve or from a photometric mass decomposition\u000amethod. We have found that the arm class is strongly related to the absolute\u000amagnitude in the mid-type spirals (in the sense that grand design galaxies are,\u000aon average, more luminous than flocculent objects), whilst this relation is\u000aconsiderably weaker in the early and late types. In general the influence of\u000athe local density on the arm structure appears to be much weaker than that of\u000athe absolute magnitude. The local density acts essentially in strengthening the\u000aarm class--absolute magnitude relation for the mid types, whereas no\u000aenvironmental density effects are observed in the early and late types. Using\u000athe most recent estimates of the disk-to-total mass ratio, we do not confirm\u000athis ratio to be a significant factor which affects the arm class;\u000anevertheless, owing to poor statistics and large uncertanties, the issue\u000aremains open. Neither a local density effect nor an unambiguous bar effect on\u000athe disk-to-total mass ratio is detectable; the latter finding may challenge\u000asome theoretical viewpoints on the formation of bar structures.\u000a

V  Using the squeezed state formalism the coherent state representation of\u000aquantum fluctuations in an expanding universe is derived. It is shown that this\u000aprovides a useful alternative to the Wigner function as a phase space\u000arepresentation of quantum fluctuations. The quantum to classical transition of\u000afluctuations is naturally implemented by decohering the density matrix in this\u000arepresentation. The entropy of the decohered vacua is derived. It is shown that\u000athe decoherence process breaks the physical equivalence between vacua that\u000adiffer by a coordinate dependent phase generated by a surface term in the\u000aLagrangian. In particular, scale invariant power spectra are only obtained for\u000aa special choice of surface term.\u000a

V  Typical nuclear equations of state and a quark bag model, surprisingly, allow\u000acompact stars with alternate layers of neutrons and quarks. One can determine\u000aon the basis of the Gibbs free energy which phase, nuclear or quark, is\u000aenergetically favorable. Using the nuclear equation of state of Wiringa, and a\u000aquark equation of state given by Freedman and McLerran, the allowed quark\u000aparameter space for such layer stars is searched. This paper differs from past\u000awork in that configurations are found in which quark matter is located exterior\u000aand interior to shells of nuclear matter, i.e., dependent on quark parameters,\u000aa star may contain several alternating layers of quark and nuclear matter.\u000aGiven the uncertainty in the quark parameter space, one can estimate the\u000aprobability for finding pure neutron stars, pure quark stars (strange stars),\u000astars with a quark core and a nucleon exterior, or layer stars. Several layer\u000amodels are presented. The physical characteristics, stability, and results of a\u000athorough search of the quark parameter space are presented.\u000a

V  We explore constraints on various forms for the effective potential during\u000ainflation based upon a statistical comparison between inflation-generated\u000afluctuations in the cosmic microwave background temperature and the COBE DMR\u000aresults. Fits to the COBE 53A+B x 90A+B angular correlation function are\u000aobtained using simple analytic forms for the effective potential in chaotic\u000ainflation models. Not surprisingly, these fits are optimized for a nearly\u000ascale-free fluctuation power spectrum. However, from the chi^2 distribution for\u000athe fits we can set upper limits of n le 1.2 and n le 7 at the 1 sigma and 2\u000asigma confidence levels, respectively, for a V(phi) = lambda phi^n effective\u000apotential. Similarly, new limits on parameters for polynomial effective\u000apotentials can be determined at the 1 sigma and 2 sigma confidence levels. The\u000amost stringent constraint, however, is on the overall magnitude of the\u000aeffective potential.\u000a

V  The analysis of whole-sky galaxy surveys commonly suffers from the problems\u000aof shot-noise and incomplete sky coverage (e.g. at the Zone of Avoidance). The\u000aorthogonal set of spherical harmonics is utilized here to expand the observed\u000agalaxy distribution. We show that in the framework of Bayesian statistics and\u000aGaussian random fields the $4 \u005cpi$ harmonics can be recovered and the\u000ashot-noise can be removed, giving the most probable picture of the underlying\u000adensity field. The correction factor from observed to reconstructed harmonics\u000aturns out to be the well-known Wiener filter (the ratio of signal to\u000asignal+noise), which is also derived by requiring minimum variance.

V  We have performed a series of N-body experiments on Connection Machine-5 in\u000aorder to simulate the formation of galaxy clusters gravitationally dominated by\u000aa massive dark background. In accordance with previous authors we find an\u000aextremely inhomogeneous evolution where subcondensations are continually formed\u000aand merged. The final distribution of galaxies is more centrally condensed than\u000athat of dark matter particles. We have analyzed the origin of this galaxy-dark\u000amatter segregation and also the origin of subclustering leading to this effect.\u000aWe have then analysed, analytically and numerically, the dependence of final\u000asegregation on the physical parameters characterizing the model of\u000aprotocluster. We also find that such a segregation persists even when inelastic\u000aencounters of dark halos around galaxies are taken into account. We conclude\u000athat this effect cannot be in general avoided in any hierarchical clustering\u000ascenario.\u000a

V  The BATSE experiment on GRO has demonstrated the isotropic arrival directions\u000aand flat $\u005clog N$ {\u005cit vs.} $\u005clog S$ of cosmic gamma-ray bursts. These data are\u000abest explained if the burst sources are distributed throughout an extended\u000aspherical Galactic halo, as previously suggested by Jennings. The halo's radius\u000ais at least 40 Kpc, and probably is more than 100 Kpc. I consider possible\u000aorigins of this halo, including primordial formation and neutron stars\u000arecoiling from their birthplaces in the Galactic disc. A simple geometrical\u000amodel leads to a predicted relation between the dipole and quadrupole\u000aanisotropy. I suggest that neutron stars born with low recoil become\u000amillisecond pulsars, while those born with high recoil become the sources of\u000agamma-ray bursts; these populations are nearly disjoint. Quiescent counterparts\u000aof gamma-ray bursts are predicted to be undetectably faint.\u000a

V  We present a new method for recovering the underlying velocity field from an\u000aobserved distribution of galaxies in redshift space. The method is based on a\u000akinematic Zel'dovich relation between the velocity and density fields in\u000aredshift space. This relation is expressed in a differential equation slightly\u000amodified from the usual Poisson equation, and which depends non-trivially on\u000a$\u005cbeta \u005cequiv \u005cOmega^{0.6}/b$. The linear equation can be readily solved by\u000astandard techniques of separation of variables by means of spherical harmonics.\u000aOne can also include a term describing the ``rocket effect" discussed by Kaiser\u000a(1987). From this redshift space information alone, one can generate a\u000aprediction of the peculiar velocity field for each harmonic ($l,m$) as a\u000afunction of distance. We note that for the quadrupole and higher order moments,\u000athe equation is a boundary value problem with solutions dependent on both the\u000ainterior and exterior mass distribution. However, for a shell at distance $r$,\u000athe dipole, as well as the monopole, of the velocity field in the Local Group\u000aframe is fully determined by the interior mass distribution. This implies that\u000athe shear of the measured velocity field, when fit to a dipole distortion,\u000ashould be aligned and consistent with the gravity field inferred from the well\u000adetermined local galaxy distribution. As a preliminary application we compute\u000athe velocity dipole of distant shells as predicted from the 1.2Jy IRAS survey\u000acompared to the measured velocity dipole on shells, as inferred from a recent\u000aPOTENT analysis. The coherence between the two fields is good, yielding a best\u000aestimate of $\u005cbeta= 0.6 \u005cpm 0.2$.\u000a

V  We review recent lattice QCD results for the surface tension at the finite\u000atemperature quark-hadron phase transition and discuss their implications on the\u000apossible scale of inhomogeneities. In the quenched approximation the average\u000adistance between nucleating centers is smaller than the diffusion length of a\u000aprotron, so that inhomogeneities are washed out by the time nucleosynthesis\u000asets in. Consequently the baryon density fluctuations formed by a QCD phase\u000atransition in the early universe cannot significantly affect standard big-bang\u000anucleosynthesis calculations and certainly cannot allow baryons to close the\u000auniverse. At present lattice results are inconclusive when dynamical fermions\u000aare included.\u000a

V  The natural outcome of theoretical calculations of microwave background\u000aanisotropy is the angular power spectrum ${\u005ccal C}_\u005cell$ as a function of\u000amultipole number $\u005cell$. Experimental ${\u005ccal C}_\u005cell$'s are needed for direct\u000acomparison. Estimation procedures using statistics linear in the pixel\u000aamplitudes as well as the conventional but less useful quadratic combinations\u000aare described. For most current experiments, a single broad-band power\u000aamplitude is all that one can get with accuracy. Results are given for the\u000aCapri-meeting detections. Mapping experiments, sensitive to many base-lines,\u000acan also give spectral ``colour'' information, either with a series of\u000acontiguous narrow-band powers or as parameterized by a local ``colour'' index\u000a$n_{\u005cDelta T}$ (scale invariant is -2, white noise is 0). Bayesian analyses of\u000athe full first year DMR and FIRS maps give very similar band-powers (\u005ceg\u000a$Q_{rms,PS}=17.9 \u005cpm 2.9 \u005cmu K$ {\u005cit c.f.} $18.6 \u005cpm 4.7 \u005cmu K$ for $n_{\u005cDelta\u000aT}=-2$) and colour indices (with 1 and 2 sigma error bars) $n_{\u005cDelta\u000aT}+3=2.0^{+0.4;+0.7}_{-0.4;-1.0}$ and $ 1.8^{+0.6;+0.9}_{-0.8;-1.3}$ ({\u005cit\u000ac.f.} the value 1.15 for a ``standard'' scale invariant CDM model). The 53 and\u000a90 GHz DMR maps, as well as the FIRS map, have residual short-distance noise\u000awhich steepens $n_{\u005cDelta T}$. Allowing the pixel error bars to increase\u000aabsorbs much of the residual, but further exploration is needed to see if a\u000asecond residual evident in the data which is responsible for the high\u000a$n_{\u005cDelta T}$ is from systematic errors or is physical.\u000a

V  Usually inflation ends either by a slow rolling of the inflaton field, which\u000agradually becomes faster and faster, or by a first-order phase transition. We\u000adescribe a model where inflation ends in a different way, due to a very rapid\u000arolling (`waterfall') of a scalar field $\u005csigma$ triggered by another scalar\u000afield $\u005cphi$. This model looks as a hybrid of chaotic inflation and the usual\u000atheory with spontaneous symmetry breaking. Another hybrid model to be discussed\u000ahere uses some building blocks from extended inflation (Brans-Dicke theory),\u000afrom new inflation (phase transition due to a non-minimal coupling of the\u000ainflaton field to gravity) and from chaotic inflation (the possibility of\u000ainflation beginning at large as well as at small $\u005csigma$). In the simplest\u000aversion of this scenario inflation ends up by slow rolling, thus avoiding the\u000abig-bubble problem of extended inflation.\u000a

V  A pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson, with a potential of the form $ V(\u005cphi) =\u000a\u005cLambda^4 [1 + \u005ccos(\u005cphi/f)]$, can naturally give rise to an epoch of inflation\u000ain the early universe (Freese, Frieman, and Olinto 1990). The potential is\u000anaturally flat (as required by microwave background limits on the amplitude of\u000adensity fluctuations), without any fine-tuning. Successful inflation can be\u000aachieved if $f \u005csim m_{pl}$ and $\u005cLambda \u005csim m_{GUT}$. Such mass scales arise\u000ain particle physics models with a large gauge group that becomes strongly\u000ainteracting at a scale $\u005csim \u005cLambda$, {\u005cit e.g.,} as can happen in the hidden\u000asector of superstring theories. The density fluctuation spectrum can be\u000anon-scale-invariant, with more power on large length scales (Adams, Bond,\u000aFreese, Frieman, and Olinto 1993). This enhanced power on large scales may be\u000auseful to explain the otherwise puzzling large-scale clustering of galaxies and\u000aclusters and their flows. Natural inflation differs from other models with\u000aextra large-scale power in that the contribution of the tensor modes to\u000amicrowave background fluctuations is negligible; this difference should serve\u000aas a testable feature of the model.\u000a

V  We study the diffusion of helium and other heavy elements in the solar\u000ainterior by solving exactly the set of flow equations developed by Burgers for\u000aa multi-component fluid, including the residual heat-flow terms. No\u000aapproximation is made concerning the relative concentrations and no restriction\u000ais placed on the number of elements considered. We give improved diffusion\u000avelocities for hydrogen, helium, oxygen and iron, in the analytic form derived\u000apreviously by Bahcall and Loeb. These expressions for the diffusion velocities\u000aare simple to program in stellar evolution codes and are expected to be\u000aaccurate to $\u005csim 15\u005c%$. Our complete treatment of element diffusion can be\u000adirectly incorporated in a standard stellar evolution code by means of an\u000aexportable subroutine, but, for convenience, we also give simple analytical\u000afits to our numerical results.\u000a

V  The anisotropy and polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation\u000a(CMBR) induced by the scalar and tensor metric perturbations are computed in\u000athe long-wavelength limit. It is found that the large-scale polarization of\u000aCMBR induced by the decaying tensor mode can reach a few percents. This is\u000adifferent from the scalar or inflation-induced tensor mode, whereas the\u000apolarization is at least two orders of magnitude lower. The effect of matter\u000are-ionization on CMBR is also considered. We conclude that measuring the\u000apolarization of CMBR on large-angular scales can probe the ionization history\u000aof the early Universe, and test different cosmological models.\u000a

V  Techniques for the statistical analysis of the \u005cLya\u005c forest in high redshift\u000aquasars are developed, and applied to the low resolution (25 \u005cAA) spectra of 29\u000aof the 33 quasars in the Schneider-Schmidt-Gunn (SSG) sample.We find that the\u000amean absorption increases with $z$ approximately as a power law\u000a$(1+z)^{\u005cgamma+1}$ with $\u005cgamma = 2.46\u005cpm 0.37$. The mean ratio of \u005cLya\u005c to\u000aLyman $\u005cbeta$ absorption in the clouds is $0.476\u005cpm 0.054$. We also detect, and\u000aobtain ratios, for Lyman $\u005cbeta$, $\u005cgamma$, and possibly $\u005cepsilon$. We are\u000aalso able to quantify the fluctuations of the absorption around its mean, and\u000afind that these are comparable to, or perhaps slightly larger than, that\u000aexpected from an uncorrelated distribution of clouds. The techniques in this\u000apaper, which include the use of bootstrap resampling of the quasar sample to\u000aobtain estimated errors and error covariances, and a mathematical treatment of\u000aabsorption from a (possibly non-uniform) stochastic distribution of lines,\u000ashould be applicable to future, more extensive, data sets.\u000a

V  This paper reviews the essential physics of gravitational instability in a\u000aRobertson-Walker background spacetime. Three approaches are presented in a\u000apedagogical manner, based on (1) the Eulerian fluid equations, (2) the\u000aLagrangian description of trajectories, and (3) the Lagrangian fluid equations.\u000aLinear and nonlinear limits are discussed for each case. Shear and tides are\u000ashown to play a key role in nonlinear gravitational instability.\u000a  The Lagrangian fluid approach is used to show that several widely held\u000abeliefs about gravitational instability are false. The following collapse\u000atheorem is proven: for a given initial density fluctuation and growth rate, the\u000aspherical tophat perturbation collapses more slowly than any other\u000aconfiguration. We also show that density maxima are not the first points to\u000acollapse and that underdense regions may collapse if their initial shear is\u000asufficiently high. The Lagrangian fluid approach leads to an almost closed set\u000aof local evolution equations for individual mass elements. The magnetic part of\u000athe Weyl tensor, which may be present even in the nonrelativistic (Newtonian)\u000alimit, may prevent a purely local description. However, neglecting the magnetic\u000apart of the Weyl tensor, we obtain predictions for high-redshift collapse that\u000aare in good agreement with a high-resolution cold dark matter N-body\u000asimulation.\u000a

V  Could COBE DMR be detecting the imprint from a spectrum of gravitational\u000awaves generated during inflation? The conventional inflationary prediction had\u000abeen that the cosmic microwave anisotropy is dominated by energy density\u000afluctuations generated during inflation and that the gravitational waves\u000acontribute negligibly. In this paper, we report on recent work (in\u000acollaboration with R. Davis, H. Hodges, and M. Turner) that has shown that the\u000aconventional wisdom may be wrong; specifically, gravitational waves may\u000adominate the anisotropy in inflationary models where the spectrum of\u000aperturbations deviates significantly from scale invariance (e.g., extended and\u000apower-law inflation models and extreme versions of chaotic inflation). If\u000agravitational waves do dominate at the large-angular scales measured by COBE\u000aDMR, the expectation and interpretation of anisotropies on small-angular scales\u000ais profoundly altered.

V  The time-dependent spectral profile of a resonance line in a homogeneous\u000aexpanding medium is studied by numerically solving an improved Fokker-Planck\u000adiffusion equation. The solutions are used to determine the time required to\u000areach a quasi-static solution near the line center. A simple scaling law for\u000athis relaxation time is derived and is fitted to the numerical results. The\u000aresults are applied to the case of Lyman alpha scattering during primordial\u000arecombination of hydrogen. For a wide range of cosmological models it is found\u000athat the relaxation times are smaller than the recombination timescale,\u000aalthough not by a very large factor. Thus the standard assumption of a\u000aquasi-static solution in cosmological recombination calculations is reasonably\u000avalid, and should not cause substantial errors in the solutions.\u000a

V  Vacuum oscillations are considered for the combined solar neutrino\u000aobservations, including the Kamiokande II spectrum data and incorporating\u000atheoretical uncertainties and their correlations. Despite the conceptual\u000adifficulty of the fine tuning between the neutrino parameters and the Sun-Earth\u000adistance, 2-flavor vacuum oscillations provide phenomenologically acceptable\u000asolutions. There are allowed regions at 99\u005c% C.L. for $\u005cDelta m^2 = (0.45 -\u000a1.2) \u005ctimes 10^{-10} \u005c; \u005cmbox{eV}\u005c,^2$ and $\u005csin^22\u005ctheta = 0.6 - 1$; the best\u000afit solution is $\u005cchi^2 / \u005cmbox{d.f.} = 19.2 / 16$, which is acceptable at 16\u005c%\u000aC.L. Oscillations for sterile neutrinos are, however, excluded by the averaged\u000adata at 99.4\u005c% C.L. The vacuum oscillation solutions predict characteristic\u000aenergy spectrum distortions and seasonal variations in Sudbury Neutrino\u000aObservatory, Super-Kamiokande, and BOREXINO. Those predictions are given in\u000adetail, emphasizing that the vacuum solutions are distinguishable from the MSW\u000asolutions.\u000a

V  If massive compact halo objects (\u005cms) are detected in ongoing searches, then\u000a\u005ctsmctlmc, the ratio of the optical depth toward the Small and Large Magellanic\u000aClouds, will be a robust indicator of the flattening of the Galactic dark\u000amatter halo. For a spherical halo, \u005ctsmctlmc\u005c is about 1.45, independent of\u000adetails of the shape of the Galactic rotation curve, the assumed mass of the\u000aGalactic disk and spheroid, and the truncation distance (if any) of the dark\u000ahalo. For an E6 halo (axis ratio $c/a = 0.4$), the ratio of optical depths is\u000a\u005ctsmctlmc\u005c $\u005csim 0.95$, again independent of assumptions about Galactic\u000aparameters. This ratio can be measured with a precision as good as $\u005csim 10\u005c%$\u000adepending on the typical mass of the MACHOs. If the halo is highly flattened\u000a(\u005ceg E6) and closely truncated (\u005ceg at twice the solar galactocentric radius),\u000athen the optical depth toward the LMC can be reduced by a factor of about two.\u000aFor these extreme parameters, and the assumption of a heavy Galactic disk and\u000aspheroid, the upper limit of the \u005cm\u005c mass range to which ongoing experiments\u000aare sensitive is reduced from ${\u005ccal O}(10^6)\u005c,M_\u005codot$ to ${\u005ccal\u000aO}(10)\u005c,M_\u005codot$.\u000a

V  Extensions of Einstein gravity which allow the gravitational constant $G$ to\u000achange with time as the universe evolves may provide a resolution to the\u000ahorizon problem without invoking a period of vacuum domination and without the\u000asubsequent entropy violation. In a cosmology for which the gravitational\u000aconstant is not in fact constant, the universe may be older at a given\u000atemperature than in a standard Hot Big Bang universe; thus, larger regions of\u000aspace could have come into causal contact at that temperature. This opens the\u000apossibility that large regions became smooth at some high temperature without\u000aviolating causality. The extra aging of the universe can be accomplished by an\u000aearly period with a large Planck mass, a period we call the MAD era (Modified\u000aAging era or the Massively Aged and Detained era). We discuss in this paper\u000atheories of gravity in which the gravitational constant is replaced with a\u000afunction of a scalar field. However, this resolution to the smoothness problem\u000a

V  The natural approach to a spectral analysis of data distributed on the sky\u000aemploys spherical harmonic decomposition. A common problem encountered in\u000apractical astronomy is the lack of full sky coverage in the available data. For\u000aexample, the removal of the galactic plane data from the COBE DMR sky maps\u000acompromises Fourier analysis of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)\u000atemperature distribution due to the loss of orthogonality of the spherical\u000aharmonics. An explicit method for constructing orthonormal functions on an\u000aincomplete (e.g. Galaxy-cut) sphere is presented. These functions should be\u000aused in the proper Fourier analysis of the COBE DMR sky maps to provide the\u000acorrect input for the determination of the spectrum of primordial\u000ainhomogeneity. The results of such an analysis are presented in an accompanying\u000aLetter. A similar algebraic construction of appropriate functions can be\u000adevised for other astronomical applications.\u000a

V  Gravitational collapse of the cylindrical elongated cloud is studied by\u000anumerical magnetohydrodynamical simulations. In the infinitely long cloud in\u000ahydrostatic configuration, small perturbations grow by the gravitational\u000ainstability. The most unstable mode indicated by a linear perturbation theory\u000agrows selectively even from a white noise. The growth rate agrees with that\u000acalculated by the linear theory. First, the density-enhanced region has an\u000aelongated shape, i.e., prolate spheroidal shape. As the collapse proceeds, the\u000ahigh-density fragment begins to contract mainly along the symmetry axis.\u000aFinally, a spherical core is formed in the non-magnetized cloud. In contrast,\u000aan oblate spheroidal dense disk is formed in a cloud in which the magnetic\u000apressure is nearly equal to the thermal one. The radial size of the disk\u000abecomes proportional to the initial characteristic density scale-height in the\u000ar-direction. As the collapse proceeds, a slowly contracting dense part is\u000aformed (approximately < 10% in mass) inside of the fast contracting disk. And\u000athis is separated from other part of the disk whose inflow velocity is\u000aaccelerated as reaching the center of the core. From arguments on the Jeans\u000amass and the magnetic critical mass, it is concluded that the fragments formed\u000ain a cylindrical elongated cloud can not be supported against the self- gravity\u000aand it will eventually collapse.\u000a

V  We have calculated gamma-ray radiative transport in regions of high energy\u000adensity, such as gamma-ray burst source regions, using a discrete ordinate,\u000adiscrete energy group method. The calculations include two-photon pair\u000aproduction and annihilation, as well as three-photon pair annihilation. The\u000aradiation field itself acts as an absorbing medium, and the optical depth\u000adepends on its intensity, so the problem is intrinsically nonlinear. Spherical\u000adivergence produces effective collimation of the flux. At high optical depth\u000athe high energy ($E > 1$ MeV) portion of the emergent spectrum assumes a nearly\u000auniversal form. An approximate limit is derived for the high energy flux from a\u000agamma-ray burst source region of given size, and the implications of this limit\u000afor the distance to the March 5, 1979 event are briefly discussed. We discuss\u000amore generally the problem of very luminous bursts, and implications of\u000aGalactic halo distances for flare models.\u000a

V  In this letter we explore the suggestion of Quashnock and Lamb (1993) that\u000anearest neighbor correlations among gamma ray burst positions indicate the\u000apossibility of burst repetitions within various burst sub-classes. With the aid\u000aof Monte Carlo calculations we compare the observed nearest neighbor\u000adistributions with those expected from an isotropic source population weighted\u000aby the published BATSE exposure map. The significance of the results are\u000aassessed via the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test, as well as by a comparison to\u000aMonte Carlo simulations. The K-S results are in basic agreement with those of\u000aQuashnock and Lamb. However, as Narayan and Piran (1993) point out, and the\u000aMonte Carlo calculations confirm, the K-S test overestimates the significance\u000aof the observed distributions. We compare the sensitivity of these results to\u000aboth the definitions of the assumed burst sub-classes and the burst positional\u000aerrors. Of the two, the positional errors are more significant and indicate\u000athat the results of Quashnock and Lamb may be due to systematic errors, rather\u000athan any intrinsic correlation among the burst positions. Monte Carlo\u000asimulations also show that with the current systematic errors, the nearest\u000aneighbor statistic is not very sensitive to moderate repetition rates. Until\u000athe BATSE statistical and systematic errors are fully understood, the burst\u000anearest neighbor correlations cannot be claimed to be significant evidence for\u000aburst repetitions.

V  I-band CCD images of a large area of the nearby globular cluster NGC~6397\u000ahave been used to construct a surface density profile and two luminosity and\u000amass functions. The surface density profile extends out to 14\u005carcm from the\u000acluster center and shows no sign of a tidal cutoff. The inner profile is a\u000apower-law with slope -0.8 steepening to -1.7 outside of 1\u005carcm. The mass\u000afunctions are for fields at 4\u005carcm\u005c and 11\u005carcm from the cluster center and\u000aconfirm the upturn in the mass function for stars less massive than about 0.4\u000aM\u005csolar.

V  The main features of the observables in the SNO and Super-Kamiokande solar\u000aneutrino experiments in the case of neutrino spin and/or spin-flavour\u000aprecession in the magnetic field of the sun are discussed.

The cosmological density parameter Omega can then be\u000aconstrained in three ways: (a) by comparing the density fields of mass and\u000agalaxies, (b) by using the velocity field in voids, and (c) by investigating\u000aquasilinear deviations from Gaussian fluctuations.

V  If gamma-ray bursts originate in our Galaxy, they probably involve violent\u000adisturbances in the magnetospheres of neutron stars. Any event of this kind is\u000alikely to trigger the sudden expulsion of magnetic flux and plasma at\u000arelativistic speed. We show that such ejecta would be braked by the\u000ainterstellar medium (ISM), and that a gamma-ray flash with duration $\u005csim 0.1 -\u000a100 $ s may result from this interaction. We suggest that the\u000astronger,``smooth"class of bursts, recently identified from analyses of BATSE\u000adata, could result from the deceleration of such a blast wave by the ISM. The\u000aradiative efficiency,and hence the detectability, of such bursts would depend\u000aon the density of the circumstellar ISM. Therefore, even if the neutron star\u000a``triggers" were uniformly distributed in space (at least within 1--2 kpc of\u000athe Sun), the bserved locations of bursts would correlate with regions of\u000aabove-average ISM density.\u000a

V  A sample of faint, V magnitude selected, galaxy pairs, having physical\u000aseparations less than approximately 20\u005chkpc, is used to examine the rise in the\u000amerger rate with redshift and the statistical relations between close pairs and\u000athe field galaxy population. Redshifts have been obtained for 14 galaxies ($V\u000a\u005cle 22.5$) that are in close ($\u005ctheta < 6\u005carcs$) pairs, along with a comparison\u000asample of 38 field galaxies. Two color photometry is available for about 1000\u000agalaxies in the same fields. The average redshift of the $V\u005cle22.5$ field\u000apopulation is 0.36, statistically equal to the average redshift of 0.42 for the\u000apairs. The similarity of the two redshift distributions, $\u005cDelta z\u005cle 0.1$,\u000alimits any differential luminosity enhancement of close pairs to less than half\u000aa magnitude. The pairs are somewhat bluer than the field and have nearly twice\u000athe average [O~II] detection rate of the field, but the differences are not\u000astatistically significant. The field population has an angular correlation at\u000aseparations of $\u005ctheta\u005cle$6\u005carcs\u005c higher than the inward extrapolation of\u000a$\u005comega(\u005ctheta)\u005cpropto \u005ctheta^{-0.8}$, which may be a population of\u000a``companions'' not present at the current epoch, or, luminosity enhancement of\u000aintrinsically faint galaxies in pairs. Physical pairs comprise about 7\u005c% of the\u000afaint galaxies in our survey fields. The same physical separation applied to\u000alocal galaxies finds only 2.6\u005c% in pairs. If the rise in close low relatively\u000avelocity pairs with redshift is parameterized as $(1+z)^m$, then $m=2.9\u005cpm0.8$.\u000aIf all pairs at low velocities and $r\u005cle 20$\u005chkpc\u005c merge, then the\u000a

V  We report on a calculation of large scale anisotropy in the cosmic microwave\u000abackground radiation in the global monopole and texture models for cosmic\u000astructure formation. We have evolved the six component linear gravitational\u000afield along with the monopole or texture scalar fields numerically in an\u000aexpanding universe and performed the Sachs-Wolfe integrals directly on the\u000acalculated gravitational fields. On scales $> 7^\u005ccirc$, we find a Gaussian\u000adistribution with an approximately scale invariant fluctuation spectrum. The\u000a$\u005cDelta T/T$ amplitude is a factor of 4-5 larger than the prediction of the\u000astandard CDM model with the same Hubble constant and density fluctuation\u000anormalization. The recently reported COBE-DMR results imply that global\u000amonopole and texture models require high bias factors or a large Hubble\u000aconstant in contrast to standard CDM which requires very low $H_0$ and bias\u000avalues. For $H_0 = 70 {\u005crm {km\u005cover sec} Mpc^{-1}}$, we find that normalizing\u000ato the COBE results implies $b_8 \u005csimeq 3.2\u005cpm 1.4$ (95\u005c% c.l.). If we restrict\u000aourselves to the range of bias factors thought to be reasonable before the\u000aannouncement of the COBE results, $1.5 \u005clsim b_8 \u005clsim 2.5$, then it is fair to\u000aconclude that global monopoles and textures are consistent with the COBE\u000aresults and are a {\u005cit better} fit than Standard CDM.\u000a

V  We consider a cosmic ray spectrum that is a power law in momentum down to a\u000acutoff and derive a lower cutoff corresponding to $E_{kin} \u005csim (30-60)$ MeV\u000afrom the observed ionization rates in nearby diffuse clouds. While the real\u000aspectra of cosmic rays may not be so simple, we argue that one expects a\u000asubstantial change in the spectra at such energies and that, at first\u000aapproximation, a power law spectra with a lower cutoff is appropriate. Such a\u000adescription of the cosmic rays in the interstellar medium is not only\u000atheoretically more attractive than the spectra used in the literature, but is\u000aalso supported by recent observations.\u000a

Non-cluster galaxy\u000aredshifts have been rejected from this sample using a likelihood ratio test\u000abased on the projected and apparent magnitude distributions of the cluster\u000afields.

V  We present results showing an improvement of the accuracy of perturbation\u000atheory as applied to cosmological structure formation for a useful range of\u000aquasilinear scales. The Lagrangian theory of gravitational instability of an\u000aEinstein-de Sitter dust cosmogony investigated and solved up to the third order\u000ain the series of papers by Buchert (1989, 1992, 1993a), Buchert \u005c& Ehlers\u000a(1993), Buchert (1993b), Ehlers \u005c& Buchert (1993), is compared with numerical\u000asimulations. In this paper we study the dynamics of pancake models as a first\u000astep. In previous work (Coles \u005cetal 1993, Melott \u005cetal 1993, Melott 1993) the\u000aaccuracy of several analytical approximations for the modeling of large-scale\u000astructure in the mildly non-linear regime was analyzed in the same way,\u000aallowing for direct comparison of the accuracy of various approximations. In\u000aparticular, the ``Zel'dovich approximation'' (Zel'dovich 1970, 1973, hereafter\u000aZA) as a subclass of the first-order Lagrangian perturbation solutions was\u000afound to provide an excellent approximation to the density field in the mildly\u000anon-linear regime (i.e. up to a linear r.m.s. density contrast of $\u005csigma\u000a\u005capprox 2$). The performance of ZA in hierarchical clustering models can be\u000agreatly improved by truncating the initial power spectrum (smoothing the\u000ainitial data). We here explore whether this approximation can be further\u000aimproved with higher-order corrections in the displacement mapping from\u000ahomogeneity. We study a single pancake model (truncated power-spectrum with\u000apower-index $n=-1$) using cross-correlation statistics employed in\u000a

V  Recent observations of Sgr A* give strong constraints for possible models of\u000athe physical nature of Sgr A* and suggest the presence of a massive black~hole\u000awith M<2 10^6 M_sun surrounded by an accretion disk which we estimate to\u000aradiate at a luminosity of <7 10^5 L_sun. We therefore calculate the appearance\u000aof a standard accretion disk around a Kerr hole in Sgr A* following from\u000ageneral relativity and a few fundamental assumptions. Effective temperature and\u000aluminosity of the disk spectra do not depend on the unknown viscosity mechanism\u000abut instead are quite sensitive to variations of intrinsic parameters: the\u000amass, the accretion rate, the angular momentum of the accreting hole and the\u000ainclination angle. A radiation field of L~7 10^4 - 7 10^5 L_sun and T_eff ~ 2-4\u000a10^4 K can be ascribed to a rapidly rotating Kerr~hole (a>0.9) accreting\u000a10^-8.5 - 10^-7 M_sun/yr at a black~hole mass of M=2 10^6 M_sunseen almost edge\u000aon. A low mass black hole of M<10^3 M_sun seems to be very unlikely. We provide\u000aa ``Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for black holes'' together with simple scaling\u000alaws to provide an easy-to-handle test for the black hole model.\u000a

V  We have obtained the best fit to the light profiles of a luminosity limited\u000asample of elliptical and S0 galaxies with a power law \u005crn, letting the exponent\u000aremain free rather than keeping it fixed at $1/n=1/4$ as in the well known \u005cGV\u000aformula. The introduction of a free parameter in the fitting formula (ranging\u000afrom $n=0.5$ for $<\u005cre>=0.3$ kpc to $n=16$ for $<\u005cre>=25$ kpc) is justified by\u000athe existence of a good correlation between $n$ and the global galaxian\u000aparameters, such as total luminosity and scale-radius. This result seems to be\u000ain line with the segregation of properties between the `ordinary' and `bright'\u000afamilies of early-type galaxies, and has consequence for the claimed\u000aindependence of the shape of galaxy profiles with respect to the Fundamental\u000aPlane parameters.\u000a

V  We analyze the cosmic peculiar velocity field as traced by a sample of 1184\u000aspiral, elliptical and S0 galaxies, grouped in 704 objects. We perform a\u000astatistical analysis, by calculating the bulk flow, Cosmic Mach Number and\u000avelocity correlation function for this sample and for mock catalogs extracted\u000afrom a set of N--body simulations. We run four cold dark matter (CDM)\u000asimulations: two tilted models (with spectral index $n=0.6$ and $n=0.8$), the\u000astandard model ($n=1$) and a ``blue" one ($n=1.2$), with different values of\u000athe linear bias parameter $b$. By means of a Maximum Likelihood analysis we\u000aestimate the ability of our models to fit the observations, as measured by the\u000aabove statistics, and to reproduce the Local Group properties. On the basis of\u000athis analysis we conclude that the best model is the unbiased standard model\u000a$(n,~b)=(1,~1)$, even though the overall flatness of the joint likelihood\u000afunction implies that one cannot strongly discriminate models in the range $0.8\u000a\u005cle n \u005cle 1$, and $1 \u005cle b \u005cle 1.5$. Models with $b \u005cgeq 2.5$ are rejected at\u000athe $95\u005c%$ confidence level. For $n=0.8$ the values of $b$ preferred by the\u000apresent analysis, together with the {\u005cem COBE} data, require a negligible\u000acontribution to $\u005cDelta T/T$ by gravitational waves. Finally, the blue model,\u000anormalized to {\u005cem COBE}, does not provide a good fit to the velocity data.\u000a

V  Recent observations of the radio and NIR source Sgr A* reinforce the\u000ainterpretation of the Galactic Center as a scaled down version of an AGN. The\u000adiscovery of an elongated structure at 43 GHz and increasing evidence for the\u000apresence of an accretion disk surrounding a Black Hole lead us to assume that\u000aboth, an accretion disk and a jet, are present in the Galactic Center and are\u000aphysically linked. We model the radio emission of Sgr A* successfully with a\u000aBlandford & K"onigl type jet and analyze the energetics of the coupled jet-disk\u000asystem in Sgr A* where jet and disk are parametrized in terms of the accretion\u000apower. With this method we are able to confirm independently the lower limit of\u000athe Sgr A* accretion rate \u005cdot M >> 10^-8.5 M_sun found previously. Moreover,\u000ausing the limits imposed by observational data, we show that within such a\u000ajet-disk model, the total jet power Q_jet is of comparable order as the\u000aradiated disk luminosity L_disk. A jet model together with the assumption of an\u000a10^6 M_sun Black Hole also qualitatively explains the submm excess and the lack\u000aof non-thermal IR radiation. The small size of the visible part of the jet (< 1\u000amas) is due to the low accretion rate of Sgr A*. <<<A&A Letters, in press>>>\u000a

V  The cosmological significance of the neutralino sector is studied for a class\u000aof models in which electroweak symmetry breaking is seeded by a gauge singlet.\u000aExtensive use is made of the renormalisation group equations to significantly\u000areduce the parameter space, by deriving analytic expressions for all the\u000asupersymmetry-breaking couplings in terms of the universal gaugino mass\u000a$m_{1/2}$, the universal scalar mass $m_0$ and the coupling $A$. The\u000acomposition of the LSP is determined exactly below the W mass, no\u000aapproximations are made for sfermion masses, and all particle exchanges are\u000aconsidered in calculating the annihilation cross-section; the relic abundance\u000ais then obtained by an analytic approximation. We find that in these models,\u000astable neutralinos may make a significant contribution to the dark matter in\u000athe universe.\u000a

It basically represents a covariant\u000ageneralization of the mechanism responsible for superconductivity, and provides\u000aa {\u005cem natural} mechanism of generation of mass which is not in conflict with\u000athe present value of the cosmological constant. When applied to\u000aSU(2)$\u005ctimes$U(1) leads to exactly the same physics (Lagrangian density) as the\u000aStandard Model but modifying {\u005cem only} the Higgs sector. It also predicts the\u000aappearance over all space of a classical scalar field as well as the existence\u000aof density fluctuations. According to it, space would be filled with a\u000amacroscopically large number of Higgs bosons which now appear as light, stable\u000ascalar particles {\u005cem decoupled} from ordinary matter and radiation. Therefore\u000athey would play the same role as the Cooper pairs in superconductivity and\u000awould be a natural candidate for dark matter.\u000a

V  We report the first results of a spectroscopic survey of galaxies in the core\u000aof the Shapley Concentration, the richest nearby supercluster of clusters of\u000agalaxies. We have measured 311 new galaxy redshifts in an area of $\u005csim 4.5$\u000asquare degrees centered around the Abell cluster A3558. Considering also the\u000adata already available in the literature, the total number of galaxy redshifts\u000ain this area amounts to more than 500. On the basis of these data we estimate\u000athe mean velocities and the velocity dispersions of the Abell clusters A3556,\u000aA3558 and the poor cluster SC 1329 -314. Finally, from an analysis of the\u000aprojected and three--dimensional distributions of galaxies in this region, we\u000aestimate the galaxy overdensity and find that the core of the Shapley\u000aConcentration has an interesting, very complex dynamical state: the main\u000aclusters appear to be interacting with each other, forming a single elongated\u000astructure containing many subcondensations.\u000a

V  We generate artificial Lick maps using $N$--body simulations and compare the\u000aangular correlation function, $w(\u005cvartheta)$, measured from the simulations\u000awith the APM correlation. For the Gaussian CDM model, neither the standard\u000abiassed model nor a more evolved model (as suggested by the COBE data),\u000areproduce the correlations on large angular scales. We come to a similar\u000aconclusion about CDM models with positively skewed initial fluctuation\u000adistributions. In contrast, models with initially negatively skewed\u000afluctuations produce a $w(\u005cvartheta)$ that declines much more gently on large\u000ascales. Such models are therefore in principle capable of reconciling the lack\u000aof large--scale power of the CDM spectrum with the observed clustering of APM\u000agalaxies.\u000a

This\u000amechanism is then shown to break spontaneously the Lorentz invariance along the\u000ainitially Goto-Nambu string. The characteristic time needed for the current to\u000abuild up is estimated and found to lowest order to depend only on the mass of\u000athe intermediate $W$ vector boson and the fine structure constant.\u000a

V  We explore the possibility of describing our universe with a\u000asingularity--free, closed, spatially homogeneous and isotropic cosmological\u000amodel, using only general relativity and a suitable equation of state which\u000aproduces an inflationary era. A phase transition to a radiation--dominated era\u000aoccurs as a consequence of boundary conditions expressing the assumption that\u000athe temperature cannot exceed the Planck value. We find that over a broad range\u000aof initial conditions, the predicted value of the Hubble parameter is\u000aapproximately $47$ km$\u005ccdot$~s$^{-1}\u005ccdot$~Mpc$^{-1}$. Inflation is driven by a\u000ascalar field, which must be conformally coupled to the curvature if the\u000aEinstein equivalence principle has to be satisfied. The form of the scalar\u000afield potential is derived, instead of being assumed a priori.\u000a

V  Lo, Sargent, and Young (1993) have recently concluded that the masses of some\u000adwarf galaxies, as deduced by the modified dynamics (MOND) from the observed\u000avelocity dispersions, are systematically smaller than the observed masses, by a\u000afactor of ten or more. We show here that the MOND mass estimator used by Lo et\u000aal. is smaller than the proper expression, by a factor of about twenty. We\u000aderive the proper mass estimator as an exact virial-like relation between the\u000a3-D rms velocity, Vs, and the total mass, M, of an arbitrary, self-gravitating\u000asystem, made of light constituents, that is everywhere in the\u000avery-low-acceleration regime of MOND. This reads M=(9/4)Vs^2/G a0. (For a\u000asystem that is not stationary, Vs involves also an average over time.) We\u000afurther generalize this relation to cases with constituent masses that are not\u000asmall compared with that of the whole system. We discuss various applications\u000aof the M-V relation. With the correct estimator the predictions of MOND are, by\u000aand large, in good agreement with the total observed masses (the observed gas\u000amass plus a stellar mass corresponding to an M/L of order one solar unit).\u000a

V  The information content of the autocorrelation function (ACF) of intensity\u000afluctuations of the X-ray background (XRB) is analyzed. The tight upper limits\u000aset by ROSAT deep survey data on the ACF at arcmin scales imply strong\u000aconstraints on clustering properties of X-ray sources at cosmological distances\u000aand on their contribution to the soft XRB. If quasars have a clustering radius\u000ar_0=12-20 Mpc (H_0=50), and their two point correlation function, is constant\u000ain comoving coordinates as indicated by optical data, they cannot make up more\u000a40-50% of the soft XRB (the maximum contribution may reach 80% in the case of\u000astable clustering, epsilon=0). Active Star-forming (ASF) galaxies clustered\u000alike normal galaxies, with r_0=10-12 Mpc can yield up to 20% or up to 40% of\u000athe soft XRB for epsilon=-1.2 or epsilon=0, respectively. The ACF on degree\u000ascales essentially reflects the clustering properties of local sources and is\u000aproportional to their volume emissivity. The upper limits on scales of a few\u000adegrees imply that hard X-ray selected AGNs have r_0<25 Mpc if epsilon=0 or\u000ar_0<20 Mpc if epsilon=-1.2. No significant constraints are set on clustering of\u000aASF galaxies, due to their low local volume emissivity. The possible signal on\u000ascales >6 deg, if real, may be due to AGNs with r_0=20 Mpc; the contribution\u000afrom clusters of galaxies with r_0~50 Mpc is a factor 2 lower.\u000a

V  Nonlinear approximations to problems with mixed boundary conditions are\u000auseful for predicting large-scale streaming velocities from the density field,\u000aor vice-versa. We evaluate the schemes of Bernardeau \u005ccite{bernardeau92},\u000aGramann \u005ccite{gramann93}, and Nusser \u005cetal \u005ccite{nusser91}, using smoothed\u000adensity and velocity fields obtained from $N$-body simulations of a CDM\u000auniverse. The approximation of Nusser \u005cetal is overall the most accurate and\u000arobust. For Gaussian smoothing of 1000\u005ckms\u005c the mean error in the approximated\u000arelative density perturbation, $\u005cdelta$, is smaller than 0.06, and the\u000adispersion is 0.1. The \u005crms\u005c error in the estimated velocity is smaller than\u000a60\u005ckms, and the dispersion is 40\u005ckms. For smoothing of 500\u005ckms\u005c these numbers\u000aincrease by about a factor $\u005csim 2$ for $\u005cdelta < 4-5$, but deteriorate at\u000ahigher densities. The other approximations are comparable to those of Nusser\u000a\u005cetal for smoothing of 1000\u005ckms, but are much less successful for the smaller\u000asmoothing of 500\u005ckms.\u000a

V  In this paper we reconsider recently derived bounds on $MeV$ tau neutrinos,\u000ataking into account previously unaccounted for effects. We find that, assuming\u000athat the neutrino life-time is longer than $O(100~sec)$, the constraint\u000a$N_{eff}<3.6$ rules out $\u005cnu_{\u005ctau}$ masses in the range\u000a$0.5~(MeV)<m_{\u005cnu_\u005ctau}<35~(MeV)$ for Majorana neutrinos and\u000a$0.74~(MeV)<m_{\u005cnu_\u005ctau}<35~(MeV)$ for Dirac neutrinos. Given that the present\u000alaboratory bound is 35 MeV, our results lower the present bound to $0.5$ and\u000a$0.74$ for Majorana and Dirac neutrinos respectively.\u000a

V  We develop a method for solving the field equations of a quadratic\u000agravitational theory coupled to matter. The quadratic terms are written as a\u000afunction of the matter stress tensor and its derivatives in such a way to have,\u000aorder by order, a set of Einstein field equations with an effective\u000a$T_{\u005cmu\u005cnu}$. We study the cosmological scenario recovering the de Sitter exact\u000asolution, and the first order (in the coupling constants $\u005calpha$ and $\u005cbeta$\u000aappearing in the gravitational Lagrangian) solution to the gauge cosmic string\u000ametric and the charged black hole. For this last solution we discuss the\u000aconsequences on the thermodynamics of black holes, and in particular, the\u000aentropy - area relation which gets additional terms to the usual ${1\u005cover4} A$\u000avalue.\u000a

V  We investigate clustering in the angular distribution of the 260 $\u005cgamma$-ray\u000abursts in the publicly available BATSE catalogue, using a nearest neighbour\u000aanalysis and the measures of burst brightness $B$ and short time scale\u000avariability $V$ which we introduced earlier. We find that while all 260 bursts\u000aare only modestly clustered (Q-value = $1.8 \u005ctimes 10^{-2}$), the 202 bursts in\u000athis sample for which the statistical error in their locations is $<9^\u005ccirc$\u000aare significantly clustered on an angular scale $\u005capprox 5^\u005ccirc$ (Q-value =\u000a$2.5 \u005ctimes 10^{-4}$, taking into acoount having chosen the cutoff in the\u000astatistical error). We also find a significant correlation between bright type\u000aI bursts and faint type I and type II bursts on an angular scale $\u005capprox\u000a5^\u005ccirc$ (Q-value = $4.0 \u005ctimes 10^{-3}$). This angular scale is smaller than\u000athe typical (statistical plus systematic) error in burst locations of\u000a$6.8^\u005ccirc$, suggesting multiple recurrences from individual sources. We\u000aconclude that ``classical'' $\u005cgamma$-ray burst sources repeat on a time scale\u000aof months, and that many faint type I and II bursts come from the sources of\u000abright type I bursts.\u000a

V  Some bright cD galaxies in cluster cooling flows have Thomson optical depths\u000aexceeding 0.01. A few percent of their luminosity is scattered and appears as\u000adiffuse polarized emission. We calculate the scattering process for different\u000ageometric combinations of luminosity sources and scattering media. We apply our\u000aresults to galaxies, with and without active nuclei, immersed in cooling flows.\u000aWe model observations of NGC 1275 and M87 (without active nuclei) in the\u000apresence of sky and galactic background fluxes which hinder the measurement of\u000athe scattered light at optical wavelengths. Current instruments are unable to\u000adetect the scattered light from such objects. However, when a galaxy has an\u000aactive nucleus of roughly the same luminosity as the remainder of the galaxy in\u000aV, both the total and polarized scattered intensity should observable on large\u000ascales (5--30kpc), meaning intensity levels greater than 1% of the background\u000alevel. For typical AGN and galaxy spectral distributions, the scattering is\u000amost easily detected at short (U) wavelengths. We point out that a number of\u000asuch cases will occur. We show that the radiation pattern from the central\u000anuclear region can be mapped using the scattering. We also show that the\u000ascattered light can be used to measure inhomogeneities in the cooling flow.\u000a

V  Fundamental assumptions which form the basis of models for large-scale\u000astructure in the Universe are sketched in light of a Lagrangian description of\u000ainhomogeneities. This description is introduced for Newtonian self-gravitating\u000aflows. On its basis a Lagrangian perturbation approach is discussed and\u000acompared with the standard Eulerian theory of gravitational instability. The\u000aperformance of Lagrangian perturbation solutions up to the third order is\u000ademonstrated in comparison with numerical N-body simulations. First results of\u000athis comparison are presented for large scales (PM-code) and for small scales\u000a(tree-code).\u000a

V  {\u005cbf Exact} solutions of the string equations of motion and constraints are\u000a{\u005cbf systematically} constructed in de Sitter spacetime using the dressing\u000amethod of soliton theory. The string dynamics in de Sitter spacetime is\u000aintegrable due to the associated linear system. We start from an exact string\u000asolution $q_{(0)}$ and the associated solution of the linear system $\u005cPsi^{(0)}\u000a(\u005clambda)$, and we construct a new solution $\u005cPsi(\u005clambda)$ differing from\u000a$\u005cPsi^{(0)}(\u005clambda)$ by a rational matrix in $\u005clambda$ with at least four\u000apoles $\u005clambda_{0},1/\u005clambda_{0},\u005clambda_{0}^*,1/\u005clambda_{0}^*$. The periodi-\u000acity condition for closed strings restrict $\u005clambda _{0}$ to discrete values\u000aexpressed in terms of Pythagorean numbers. Here we explicitly construct solu-\u000ations depending on $(2+1)$-spacetime coordinates, two arbitrary complex numbers\u000a(the 'polarization vector') and two integers $(n,m)$ which determine the string\u000awindings in the space. The solutions are depicted in the hyperboloid coor-\u000adinates $q$ and in comoving coordinates with the cosmic time $T$. Despite of\u000athe fact that we have a single world sheet, our solutions describe {\u005cbf multi-\u000aple}(here five) different and independent strings; the world sheet time $\u005ctau$\u000aturns to be a multivalued function of $T$.(This has no analogue in flat space-\u000atime).One string is stable (its proper size tends to a constant for $T\u005cto\u005cinfty\u000a$, and its comoving size contracts); the other strings are unstable (their\u000aproper sizes blow up for $T\u005cto\u005cinfty$, while their comoving sizes tend to cons-\u000atants). These solutions (even the stable strings) do not oscillate in time. The\u000ainterpretation of these solutions and their dynamics in terms of the sinh-\u000aGordon model is particularly enlighting.\u000a

V  Two families of hot stellar systems, named {\u005cit `ordinary'\u005c/} and {\u005cit\u000a'bright'\u005c/}, are identified in the ($\u005clog R_e, \u005cmu_e$) plane built with a\u000aluminosity--limited sample of ellipticals and bulges of S0s and spirals of the\u000aVirgo and Fornax clusters. This finding, based on {\u005cit ad hoc\u005c/} new\u000aobservations, is confirmed by a much larger set of literature data for\u000a$\u005csim1500$ galaxies. The {\u005cit `ordinary'\u005c/} family is biparametric: $L_T\u005cpropto\u000aI_e\u005c,R_e^2$; its members are fainter that $M_B\u005csimeq-19.3$ and smaller than\u000a$\u005cre\u005csimeq3$ kpc (whatever $M_B$ is). The {\u005cit 'bright'\u005c/} family is\u000auniparametric ($\u005cmu_e$ depends on $R_e$ alone) and hosts brightest cluster\u000amembers and QSO parent galaxies. We show that the segregation in the ($\u005clog\u000aR_e, \u005cmu_e$) plane has an important counterpart in the behavior of various\u000aphysical parameters, which is markedly different for galaxies smaller ({\u005cit\u000a`ordinary'\u005c/} family) and larger ({\u005cit 'bright'\u005c/} family) than $R_e=3$ kpc.\u000a

V  We describe an efficient Particle-Mesh algorithm for the Connection Machine\u000aCM-5. Our particular method parallelizes well and the computation time per time\u000astep decreases as the particles become more clustered. We achieve\u000afloating-point computation rates of 4--5 MFlops/sec/processing node and total\u000aoperations (the sum of floating-point and integer arithmetic plus\u000acommunications) of 5--10 MOps/sec/processing node. The rates scale almost\u000alinearly from 32 to 256 processors. Although some of what we discuss is\u000aspecific to the CM-5, many aspects (e.g., the computation of the force on a\u000amesh) are generic to all implementations, and other aspects (e.g., the\u000aalgorithm for assignment of the density to the mesh) are useful on any parallel\u000acomputer.\u000a

V  A phenomenological power spectrum of primordial density perturbations has\u000abeen constructed by using both COBE data to probe the large wavelength region,\u000aand a double power law, locally deduced from galaxy catalogs, which describes\u000athe matter correlation function up to tens of Megaparsec. The shape of the\u000aspectrum P(k) of density fluctuations exhibits a peak that singles out a\u000acharacteristic wavelength proportional to the cutoff radius R0 in the matter\u000adistribution (comparable to the distance at which matter becomes\u000aanticorrelated). {}From a least squares fit to COBE's angular correlation\u000afunction we obtain R0 = 35 +- 12 Mpc/h for the correlation length, and n = 0.76\u000a+- 0.3 for the spectral index of P(k) in the large wavelength region. The\u000ainferred scale in the spectrum is 51 +- 18 Mpc/h. This number agrees with that\u000aderived from the analysis of the correlation function of matter and with a\u000apreferred scale identified in IRAS PSC.\u000a

V  The {\u005cit COBE} DMR sky maps contain low-level correlated noise. We obtain\u000aestimates of the amplitude and pattern of the correlated noise from three\u000atechniques: angular averages of the covariance matrix, Monte Carlo simulations\u000aof two-point correlation functions, and direct analysis of the DMR maps. The\u000aresults from the three methods are mutually consistent. The noise covariance\u000amatrix of a DMR sky map is diagonal to an accuracy of better than 1\u005c%. For a\u000agiven sky pixel, the dominant noise covariance occurs with the ring of pixels\u000aat an angular separation of $60 \u005cdeg$ due to the $60 \u005cdeg$ separation of the\u000aDMR horns. The mean covariance at $60 \u005cdeg$ is $0.45\u005c% ^{+0.18}_{-0.14}$ of the\u000amean variance. Additionally, the variance in a given pixel is $0.7\u005c%$ greater\u000athan would be expected from a single beam experiment with the same noise\u000aproperties. Auto-correlation functions suffer from a $\u005csim 1.5\u005c; \u005csigma$\u000apositive bias at $60 \u005cdeg$ while cross-correlations have no bias.

V  We present a study of the stellar content of the open cluster M67. We have\u000acomputed new evolutionary sequences of stellar models with solar abundance that\u000acover all phases of evolution from the Zero-Age Main Sequence to the bright end\u000aof the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB). We examine the fit between the calculated\u000aand the observed red giant branch (RGB) in particular, and discuss factors that\u000amost influence its quality. The distinct color gap between the RGB and the\u000aclump giants is compared with the temperature gap between the He-burning tracks\u000aand the computed 5 Gyr isochrone. This purely differential approach strongly\u000aindicates that the clump giants have M $\u005clta 0.70\u005cmsun\u005c $, implying an amount\u000aof mass loss ($\u005capprox 0.6$ \u005cmsun) well in excess of that found in globular\u000acluster stars. Observational constraints on mass loss processes favor the\u000ainterpretation that mass loss in cool low-mass giant stars increases with\u000ametallicity.\u000a

V  There is accumulating observational evidence suggesting that damped\u000aLy$\u005calpha$ absorption systems systems are the progenitors of present-day spiral\u000agalaxies. We use the observed properties of these systems to place constraints\u000aon the history of star formation in galactic disks, and on cosmological\u000atheories of structure formation in the universe. We show that the observed\u000aincrease in $\u005cOmega_{HI}$ contributed by damped Ly$\u005calpha$ systems at high\u000aredshift implies that star formation must have been considerably less efficient\u000ain the past. We also show that the data can constrain cosmological models in\u000awhich structure forms at late epochs. A mixed dark matter (MDM) model with\u000a$\u005cOmega_{\u005cnu}=0.3$ is unable to reproduce the mass densities of cold gas seen\u000aat high redshift, even in the absence of any star formation. We show that at\u000aredshifts greater than 3, this model predicts that the total baryonic mass\u000acontained in dark matter halos with circular velocities $V_c > 35$ km s$^{-1}$\u000ais less than the observed mass of HI in damped systems. At these redshifts, the\u000aphoto-ionizing background would prevent gas from dissipating and collapsing to\u000aform high column density systems in halos smaller than 35 km s$^{-1}$. MDM\u000amodels are thus ruled out by the observations.\u000a

V  We present a solution for the relative positions and orientations of the four\u000aCCD chips on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Planetary Camera (PC). An\u000aaccurate solution is required when matching HST images with ground-based images\u000aor with one another. The solution is accurate to about 1/4 PC pixel or about\u000a$0{.\u005chskip-2pt ''} 01$, a 30-fold improvement over the best previous solution.\u000aThe CCDs are rotated relative to one another by up to $1^\u005ccirc$. The solution\u000ais based on images taken between December 1990 and June 1992 and is stable over\u000athat entire period. We find that the pixel size is $0{.\u005chskip-2pt ''}04373\u005cpm\u000a0{.\u005chskip-2pt ''}00004$ based on comparison with HST Guide Stars, in good\u000aagreement with previous Guide-Star based calibrations but $\u005csim 1\u005c%$ smaller\u000athan a globular-cluster based calibration.\u000a

V  We point out that in general the Reissner-Nordstr\u005c"om (RN) charged black\u000aholes of general relativity are not solutions of the four dimensional quadratic\u000agravitational theories. They are, e.g., exact solutions of the $R+R^2$\u000aquadratic theory but not of a theory where a $R_{ab}R^{ab}$ term is present in\u000athe gravitational Lagrangian. In the case where such a non linear curvature\u000aterm is present with sufficiently small coupling, we obtain an approximate\u000asolution for a charged black hole of charge $Q$ and mass $M$. For $Q\u005cll M$ the\u000avalidity of this solution extends down to the horizon. This allows us to\u000aexplore the thermodynamic properties of the quadratic charged black hole and we\u000afind that, to our approximation, its thermodynamics is identical to that of a\u000aRN black hole. However our black hole's entropy is not equal to the one fourth\u000aof the horizon area. Finally we extend our analysis to the rotating charged\u000ablack hole and qualitatively similar results are obtained.\u000a

V  When a source of gravity waves is conveniently placed between the Earth and\u000asome source of light, preferably a pulsating source, the magnitude of time\u000adelays induced by the gravity waves could, in optimal situations, be not too\u000afar out of the reach of already existing technology. Besides the odd case of\u000anear-to-perfect alignment one might be lucky enough to encounter in the Galaxy,\u000athere exists several astronomical sites where good alignment occurs naturally.\u000aA good example is when the light source and the gravity-wave source are,\u000arespectively, a high-frequency pulsar and a neutron star, locked together in a\u000atight binary. We are lead to believe that neutron-star gravity waves might be\u000adirectly observable in timing data of systems such as PSR B1913+16.\u000a

V  Recent large scale structure observations, including COBE, have prompted many\u000aauthors to discuss modifications of the standard Cold Dark Matter model. Two of\u000athese, a tilted spectrum and a gravitational wave contribution to COBE, are at\u000asome level demanded by theory under the usual assumption that inflation\u000agenerates the primeval perturbations. The third, whose motivation comes by\u000acontrast from observation, is the introduction of a component of hot dark\u000amatter to give the Mixed Dark Matter model. We discuss the implication of\u000ataking these modifications together. Should Mixed Dark Matter prove necessary,\u000avery strong constraints on inflationary models will ensue.\u000a

V  We consider charged boson stars and study their effect on the structure of\u000athe vacuum. For very compact particle like ``stars", with constituent mass\u000a$m_{*}$ close to the Planck mass $m_{Pl}$, i.e. $m_{*}^{2} = {\u005ccal O} (\u005calpha\u000am_{Pl}^{2})$, we argue that there is a limiting total electric charge $Z_c$,\u000awhich, primarily, is due to the formation of a pion condensate ($Z_{c} \u005csimeq\u000a0.5\u005calpha^{-1}e$, where $\u005calpha$ is the fine structure constant and $e$ is the\u000aelectric charge of the positron). If the charge of the ``star" is larger than\u000a$Z_c$ we find numerical evidence for a complete screening indicating a limiting\u000acharge for a very compact object.\u000a  There is also a less efficient competing charge screening mechanism due to\u000aspontaneous electron-positron pair creation in which case $Z_{c} \u005csimeq\u000a\u005calpha^{-1}e$. Astrophysical and cosmological abundances of charged compact\u000aboson stars are briefly discussed in terms of dark matter.\u000a

It is shown that\u000atwo methods of estimating the solar neutrino flux uncertainties are equivalent:\u000a(a) a simple parametrization of the uncertainties using the core temperature\u000aand the nuclear production cross sections; (b) the Monte Carlo method of\u000aBahcall and Ulrich.  In the MSW analysis, we emphasize proper treatments of\u000acorrelation of theoretical uncertainties between flux components and between\u000adifferent detectors, the Earth effect, and multiple solutions in a combined\u000a$\u005cchi^2$ procedure. The MSW solutions for various standard and nonstandard\u000asolar models are also shown. The MSW predictions of the global solutions for\u000athe future solar neutrino experiments are given, emphasizing the measurement of\u000athe energy spectrum and the day-night effect in Sudbury Neutrino Observatory\u000aand Super-Kamiokande to distinguish the two solutions.\u000a

V  The standard bounce formalism for calculating the decay rate of a metastable\u000avacuum cannot be applied to theories in which the symmetry breaking is due to\u000aradiative corrections, because in such theories the tree-level action has no\u000abounce solutions. In this paper I derive a modified formalism to deal with such\u000acases. As in the usual case, the bubble nucleation rate may be written in the\u000aform $A e^{-B}$. To leading approximation, $B$ is the bounce action obtained by\u000areplacing the tree-level potential by the leading one-loop approximation to the\u000aeffective potential, in agreement with the generally adopted {\u005cit ad hoc}\u000aremedy. The next correction to $B$ (which is proportional to an inverse power\u000aof a small coupling) is given in terms of the next-to-leading term in the\u000aeffective potential and the leading correction to the two-derivative term in\u000athe effective action. The corrections beyond these (which may be included in\u000athe prefactor) do not have simple expressions in terms of the effective\u000apotential and the other functions in the effective action. In particular, the\u000ascalar-loop terms which give an imaginary part to the effective potential do\u000anot explicitly appear; the corresponding effects are included in a functional\u000adeterminant which gives a manifestly real result for the nucleation rate.\u000a

V  The Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783 was intensely monitored between 1991 December\u000aand 1992 August. We present the results from the ground-based observations in\u000athe optical and near-IR, which complement the data-set from the IUE, discussed\u000aelsewhere. Spectroscopic and photometric data from many observatories were\u000acombined in order to obtain well sampled light curves of the continuum and of\u000aH-Beta. During the campaign the source varied significantly. The light curves\u000aof the optical continuum and of H-Beta are similar to those obtained with the\u000aIUE. The near-IR flux did not vary significantly except for an increase at the\u000aend of the campaign. The optical continuum and the flux of H-Beta lag the UV\u000acontinuum by 1 day or less and by 8 days respectively. These results confirm\u000athat the continuum variations are simultaneous or have a very small lag across\u000athe entire UV-optical range, and that the lines of NGC 3783 respond to ionizing\u000acontinuum variations with less delay than those of NGC 5548. As in NGC 5548,\u000athe lag of H-Beta is greater than those of the high ionization lines.\u000a

V  This paper focuses on two aspects of the Physics of Radio Galaxies in which\u000ait has been proposed that relativistic beaming of radiation is necessary to\u000aaccount for the observations. Physical arguments are presented which show that\u000ait is quite plausible that the jets in FRI radio galaxies are relativistic on\u000athe parsec scale and decelerate to subrelativistic flow on the kiloparsec\u000ascale. On the other hand it is shown that beaming of the optical continuum from\u000athe core of Centaurus~A is not necessary to account for the excitation of the\u000aemission line filaments in the ISM of this galaxy. Models involving\u000aautoionizing shocks produced by the interaction between a low Mach number jet\u000aand dense clouds along its path are capable of explaining the morphology of the\u000afilaments and the simultaneous high excitation and low excitation lines in\u000atheir spectra.\u000a

V  We describe an analytic distribution function of a finite, oblate stellar\u000asystem that is useful for the practical modelling of dark halos. The function\u000ais determined by lowering Evans's (1993) distribution function of a flattened,\u000acored isothermal system in analogy to the lowering of the singular, isothermal\u000asphere in the definition of the King (1966) models. We derive analytic\u000aexpressions of the density, maximal streaming velocity and velocity dispersion\u000aprofiles as a function of the potential. As for the King models, the potential\u000amust be calculated numerically. We also present a recipe for generating N-body\u000arealizations of this distribution function and examine the stability in three\u000amodels with dimensionless spins $\u005clambda=$0.0, 0.05 and 0.18 using N-body\u000asimulations with 50,000 particles. The $\u005clambda=0.18$ model is unstable to the\u000aformation of a triaxial bar within $\u005csim 5$ King radii while the other models\u000aappear stable. We conclude that the slowly rotating systems are useful for\u000amodelling flattened dark halos.\u000a

V  We construct a simple analytical model to study the effects of cosmic strings\u000aon the microwave background radiation. Our model is based on counting random\u000amultiple impulses inflicted on photon trajectories by the string network\u000abetween the time of recombination and today. We construct the temperature\u000aauto-correlation function and use it to obtain the effective power spectrum\u000aindex n, the rms-quadrupole-normalized amplitude $Q_{rms-PS}$ and the rms\u000atemperature variation smoothed on small angular scales. For the values of the\u000ascaling solution parameters obtained in Refs.\u005ccite{bb90},\u005ccite{as90} we obtain\u000a$n=1.14 \u005cpm 0.5$, $Q_{rms-PS}=(4.5\u005cpm 1.5) G\u005cmu$ and $({{\u005cDelta T}\u005cover\u000aT})_{rms}=5.5 G\u005cmu$. Demanding consistency of these results with the COBE data\u000aleads to $G\u005cmu=(1.7 \u005cpm 0.7)\u005ctimes 10^{-6}$ (where $\u005cmu$ is the string mass per\u000aunit length), in good agreement with direct normalizations of $\u005cmu$ from\u000aobservations.\u000a

V  We investigate reheating of the universe by early formation of stars and\u000aquasars in the hierarchical clustering scheme of cold dark matter scenario,\u000awith perturbation fluctuations normalized by the COBE data. It is found that\u000aionizing uv flux from OB stars with the abundance given by the standard initial\u000amass function is strong enough to ionize the universe from $z\u005capprox 30$ to the\u000apresent epoch, if 1--2\u005c% of the collapsed baryons go into stars. This lessens\u000asignificantly the CMB anisotropies at a small angular scale. Reionization also\u000aincreases the Jeans mass to $M_{\u005crm luminous}\u005capprox 10^9M_\u005codot$ for $z\u005clsim\u000a10$, which leads to a cut-off of the luminosity function of normal galaxies on\u000aa faint side. A strong uv flux is expected at $z\u005capprox 2-5$, and the null\u000aresult of the Gunn-Peterson test is naturally explained. Early star formation\u000aalso results in production of heavy elements, and the observational metal\u000aabundance sets a strong constraint on the photon energy injection into the\u000aintergalactic space.\u000a

V  This is a review of the Cold Dark Matter model of structure formation, and\u000aits variants. The approach is largely from first principles, the main aim being\u000ato impart a basic understanding of the relevant theory with an eye to the\u000alikely intense activity of the next few years, but the current observational\u000astatus of the model is also critically assessed. The evolution of adiabatic and\u000aisocurvature density perturbations is described, and their effect on the large\u000ascale cmb anisotropy calculated as well as that of any gravitational waves. The\u000ageneration of all three types of perturbation during inflation is described,\u000aand the normalisation and spectral indices are calculated in terms of the\u000ainflationary potential and its first and second derivatives. The comparison of\u000athe theory with each type of observation is described, starting with the COBE\u000adata and moving down in scale to the non-linear regime. Constraints on the\u000aspectrum of the adiabatic density perturbation are exhibited, the spectrum\u000abeing parametrised by its normalisation and its degree of tilt. Finally\u000aextensions of the CDM model are considered, which replace some of the cold dark\u000amatter by hot dark matter or a cosmological constant.\u000a

V  The recent {\u005csl ROSAT \u005c/} X-ray detections of hot intergalactic gas in three\u000agroups of galaxies are reviewed and the resulting baryonic fraction in these\u000agroups is reevaluated. We show that the baryonic fraction obtained, assuming\u000ahydrostatic equilibrium, should depend, perhaps sensitively, on the radius out\u000ato which the X-rays are detected, and the temperature profile of the gas. We\u000afind that the NGC 2300 group has a baryonic fraction out to $25'$ of at least\u000a20\u005c%, thus over five times higher than in the original analysis of Mulchaey\u000a\u005cetal\u005c (1993), and also much higher than one would obtain from big-bang\u000anucleosynthesis, but similar to the other two groups as well as rich clusters.\u000aWith this baryonic fraction, groups would be fair tracers of the distribution\u000aof baryons in the Universe if $\u005cOmega h_{50}^2 = 0.3$. A baryonic fraction that\u000aincreases with radius is consistent with the X-ray data from all three groups.\u000aHowever, a detailed analysis of the NGC 2300 group shows that the dependence of\u000abaryonic fraction on radius is not well constrained by the data, in part\u000abecause of uncertainties in the estimated background.\u000a

V  The recent detection of microlensing of stars of LMC by compact objects in\u000athe halo of our galaxy suggests that our galaxy is surrounded by a non-luminous\u000ahalo made of compact objects with mass of about $(0.03-0.5) \u005cmsun$. The rate of\u000adetection could be consistent with the assumption that these halo objects are\u000adistributed with a softened isothermal profile with a core radius of $(2-8)$Kpc\u000aand asymptotic circular velocity of $220\u005ckms$. Taken in isolation, this\u000aobservation is consistent with a universe having only baryonic dark matter\u000a(BDM, hereafter) contributing $\u005cOmega_b=\u005cOmega_{total}\u005csimeq0.06$ which will,\u000ahowever, violently contradict several other large scale observations, notably\u000athe COBE-DMR results. Alternatively one can assume that galaxies like ours are\u000asurrounded by both BDM and non-baryonic dark matter (NBDM, hereafter). A model\u000awith a single component for NBDM with, say,\u000a$\u005cOmega_b\u005csimeq0.06,\u005cOmega_{cdm}\u005csimeq0.94$, is also ruled out if we demand\u000athat: (i) at least thirty percent of the dark matter density within $100$ kpc\u000ais baryonic and (ii) galactic structures should have collapsed by redshift of\u000a$z=1$. Further if half or more of the dark matter within $100 kpc$ is baryonic\u000athen the maximum value of $\u005cOmega_{dm}$, contributed by NBDM clustered at\u000agalactic scales, can only be about $\u005cOmega_{max}\u005csimeq0.29$. Models with C+HDM\u000acannot satisfy this constraint but $\u005cLambda$+ CDM models are still\u000a

V  HQM is an optical broad-band photometric monitoring program carried out since\u000aSept.~1988. Our main intention is to search for indications of microlensing in\u000aa sample of $\u005csim$\u005c,100 selected quasars; however, we also want to study the\u000aintrinsic variability. We use a CCD camera equipped to the MPIA 1.2$\u005c,$m\u000atelescope. Fully automatic photometric reduction relative to stars in the frame\u000ais done within a few minutes after each exposure, thus interesting brightness\u000achanges can be followed in detail. The typical photometric error is 1--2\u005c,\u005c%\u000afor a 17.5\u005c,mag quasar, making HQM the most accurate long-term quasar\u000amonitoring program yet carried out. The main results of HQM which we discuss\u000ahere are: (1) Concerning variability, quasars form two, clearly distinct\u000aclasses, optically violent variables (OVVs) and non-OVVs. (2) All OVVs are\u000aradio loud and probably belong to the blazar class. (3) Non-OVVs have\u000alightcurve gradients of at most several 0.1\u005c,mag\u005c,yr$^{-1}$ in the quasar\u000arestframe and can be well fitted by polynomials of low order. (4) Although our\u000adata cover only a relatively short timespan, we conclude that there is a large\u000afraction of quasars which would be undetectable in photographic surveys using\u000aoptical variability alone as the selection criterium. (5) A broad class of\u000aflat-spectrum radio quasars are no blazars, they are even less variable in the\u000aoptical than radio quiet objects. (6) There is some statistical evidence for\u000amicrolensing in our sample; if present it does, however, lead only to low\u000alightcurve gradients.\u000a

V  We analyze the sensitivity of a network of interferometer gravitational-wave\u000adetectors to the gravitational-wave stochastic background, and derive the\u000adependence of this sensitivity on the orientations of the detector arms. We\u000abuild on and extend the recent work of Christensen, but our conclusion for the\u000aoptimal choice of orientations of a pair of detectors differs from his. For a\u000apair of detectors (such as LIGO) that subtends an angle at the center of the\u000aearth of $\u005c,\u005calt 70^\u005ccirc$, we find that the optimal configuration is for each\u000adetector to have its arms make an angle of $45^\u005ccirc$ (modulo $90^\u005ccirc$) with\u000athe arc of the great circle that joins them. For detectors that are farther\u000aseparated, each detector should instead have one arm aligned with this arc. We\u000aalso describe in detail the optimal data-analysis algorithm for searching for\u000athe stochastic background with a detector network, which is implicit in earlier\u000awork of Michelson. The LIGO pair of detectors will be separated by $\u005csim 3000\u000a\u005c, {\u005crm km}$. The minimum detectable stochastic energy-density for these\u000adetectors with their currently planned orientations is $\u005csim 3\u005c%$ greater than\u000awhat it would be if the orientations were optimal.\u000a

V  The simplest model that can accomodate a viable nonbaryonic dark matter\u000acandidate is the standard electroweak theory with the addition of right-handed\u000aor sterile neutrinos. We reexamine this model and find that the sterile\u000aneutrinos can be either hot, warm, or cold dark matter. Since their only direct\u000acoupling is to left-handed or active neutrinos, the most efficient production\u000amechanism is via neutrino oscillations. If the production rate is always less\u000athan the expansion rate, then these neutrinos will never be in thermal\u000aequilibrium. However, enough of them may be produced so that they provide the\u000amissing mass necessary for closure. We consider a single generation of neutrino\u000afields $\u005cleft (\u005cnu_L,\u005c,\u005cnu_R\u005cright )$ with a Dirac mass, $\u005cmu$, and a Majorana\u000amass for the right-handed components only, $M$. For $M\u005cgg \u005cmu$ we show that the\u000anumber density of sterile neutrinos is proportional to $\u005cmu^2/M$ so that the\u000aenergy density today is {\u005cit independent of} $M$. However $M$ is crucial in\u000adetermining the large scale structure of the Universe. In particular, $M\u005csimeq\u000a0.1-1.0 {\u005crm ~keV}$ leads to warm dark matter and a structure formation\u000ascenario that may have some advantages over both the standard hot and cold dark\u000amatter scenarios.\u000a

V  We show that under certain astrophysical conditions a binary system\u000aconsisting of two compact objects can be stabilized against indefinite\u000ashrinking of orbits due to the emission of gravitational radiation. In this\u000acase, the lighter binary companion settles down to a stable orbit when the loss\u000aof the angular momentum due to gravitational radiation becomes equal to its\u000again from the accreting matter from the disk around the more massive primary.\u000aWe claim that such systems can be stable against small perturbations and can be\u000aregarded as steady emitters of gravitational waves of constant frequency and\u000aamplitude. Furthermore, X-rays emitted by the secondary can also produce\u000aastrophysically interesting situations when coupled with gravitational lensing\u000aand Doppler effects.\u000a

However, the degree of activity is very low and can\u000abarely account for the energetics of the whole central region. Neverthelss, in\u000athe very inner arsecond the central engine becomes dominant and provides an\u000ainteresting laboratory for the physics of central engines (Black Holes) in\u000agalactic nuclei.

V  The contribution of gravitational wave (tensor metric) and energy density\u000a(scalar metric) fluctuations to the cosmic microwave background polarization is\u000acomputed by numerically solving the relativistic radiation transfer equations.\u000aWe find that the tensor contribution is significant only at large angular\u000ascales (multipoles $\u005cell \u005clta 40$). For standard recombination, the tensor\u000acontribution can dominate at $\u005cell \u005clta 40$; however, the effect would be\u000adifficult to detect since the total (scalar plus tensor) polarization is $<\u000a1$\u005c%. For models with late reionization, the total large angular scale\u000apolarization is large ($\u005csim 7-9$\u005c%), but the tensor fraction is negligibly\u000asmall. Hence, polarization may be useful for discriminating ionization history,\u000abut is much less promising as a means for detecting tensor fluctuations.\u000a

V  We present first results concerning the metallicities and stellar populations\u000aof galaxies formed in a cosmologically motivated simulation. The calculations\u000ainclude dark matter, gas dynamics, radiation processes, star formation,\u000asupernovae feedback, and metal enrichment. A rotating, overdense sphere with a\u000amass of $8\u005c,10^{11}\u005c,$\u005cMsol\u005c serves as initial model. Converging and Jeans\u000aunstable regions are allowed to form stars, which get their metallicity from\u000athe gas they are formed from. Via supernovae, metal enriched gas is given back\u000ato the interstellar medium. The forming galaxy shows the main properties of\u000aspiral galaxies: A metal rich bulge, a metal poor stellar halo and a disk of\u000anearly solar composition. Halo and bulge consist predominantly of old stars\u000a($>10.5\u005c,$Gyrs). The disk has a metallicity gradient of $\u005cdd(\u005clog Z) / \u005cdd r =\u000a- 0.05\u005c,$kpc$^{-1}$, whereas the halo shows none. The models also exhibit a\u000acorrelation between the metallicity of Pop~II stars and the power of small\u000ascale fluctuations. The stars of the bulge form from gas which is initially\u000alocated in the largest maxima of the primordial density fluctuations, whereas\u000athe halo stars originate from gas accumulated in less pronounced maxima.\u000a

V  {}From deep optical images of three clusters selected by virtue of their\u000aX-ray luminosity and/or optical richness (1455+22; $z=0.26$, 0016+16; $z=0.55$\u000aand 1603+43; $z=0.89$), we construct statistically-complete samples of faint\u000afield galaxies ($I \u005cleq 25$) suitable for probing the effects of gravitational\u000alensing. By selecting clusters across a wide redshift range we separate the\u000aeffects of the mean redshift distribution of the faint field population well\u000abeyond spectroscopic limits and the distribution of dark matter in the lensing\u000aclusters. A significant lensing signature is seen in the two lower redshift\u000aclusters whose X-ray properties are well-constrained. Based on these and\u000adynamical data, it is straightforward to rule out field redshift distributions\u000afor $I \u005cleq 25$ which have a significant low redshift excess compared to the no\u000aevolution prediction, such as would be expected if the number counts at faint\u000alimits were dominated by low-$z$ dwarf systems. The degree to which we can\u000aconstrain any high redshift tail to the no evolution redshift distribution\u000adepends on the distribution of dark matter in the most distant lensing cluster.\u000aIn the second paper in this series, we use the lensing signal to reconstruct\u000athe full two-dimensional mass distribution in the clusters and, together with\u000ahigh resolution X-ray images, demonstrate that their structural properties are\u000awell-understood. The principal result is therefore the absence of a dominant\u000alow-$z$ dwarf population to $I \u005cleq25$.\u000a

A novel\u000acorrelation between the neutralino relic abundance $\u005cOmega_\u005cchi$ and the soft\u000asupersymmetry breaking patterns is demonstrated. It is explained that, this\u000ageneric result together with the proton-decay constraint could significantly\u000areduce the allowed parameter space of the minimal $SU(5)$ supergravity model,\u000aand therefore makes this model more easily testable. The prospect of obtaining\u000afurther cosmological constraints from underground experiments for the minimal\u000a$SU(5)$ supergravity model is also briefly discussed.\u000a

The evolution of this boson during inflation\u000agenerates a magnetic field; however, it seems difficult on rather general\u000agrounds to obtain fields of sufficient strength on astrophysically interesting\u000ascales.\u000a

V  The ages of globular clusters inferred from observations depends sensitively\u000aon assumptions like the initial helium abundance and the mass loss rate. A high\u000ahelium abundance (e.g., $Y\u005capprox$0.28) or a mass loss rate of\u000a$\u005csim$10$^{-11}M_\u005codot$ yr$^{-1}$ near the main sequence turn-off region lowers\u000athe current age estimate from 14 Gyr to about 10--12 Gyr, significantly\u000arelaxing the constraints on the Hubble constant, allowing values as high as\u000a60km/sec/Mpc for a universe with the critical density and 90km/sec/Mpc for a\u000abaryon-only universe. Possible mechanisms for the helium enhancement in\u000aglobular clusters are discussed, as are arguments for an instability strip\u000ainduced mass loss near the turn-off. Ages lower than 10 Gyr are not possible\u000aeven with the operation of both of these mechanisms unless the initial helium\u000aabundance in globular clusters is $>0.30$, which would conflict with indirect\u000ameasurements of helium abundances in globular clusters.\u000a

V  Results are presented for one-dimensional numerical hydrodynamics\u000acomputations of the structure and evolution of Lya forest clouds\u000agravitationally confined by dark matter minihalos. The clouds are developed\u000afrom linear perturbations at high redshift and exposed to either a QSO- or\u000agalaxy-dominated metagalactic radiation field at moderate redshifts. While the\u000aemphasis is on spherical systems, slab symmetry is also considered. Three zones\u000amay be identified in a collapsed cloud: (1) a quasi-hydrostatic core in thermal\u000aequilibrium, (2) a nonhydrostatic intermediate zone out of thermal equilibrium,\u000aand (3) a cosmological accretion layer joining onto the Hubble expansion. Most\u000aof the measured Lya forest column densities arise in the intermediate zone. The\u000adevelopment of the core would result in a flattening in the column density\u000adistribution near an HI column density of 10**15-10**16 cm**-2. The cloud\u000adiameters corresponding to an HI column density of 10**14 cm**-2 lie in the\u000arange 10-60 kpc, while systems with column densities exceeding 10**15 cm**-2\u000ahave diameters smaller than 10 kpc. Systems with circular velocities exceeding\u000a50 km/s result in clouds which contract until they become Jeans unstable and\u000acollapse. The critical column density for collapse is 10**17-10**18 cm**-2. A\u000amild correlation of Doppler parameter with neutral hydrogen column density is\u000afound in several models for systems with column densities less than 10**13.5\u000acm**-2, with Doppler parameters occurring as low as b > 20 km/s for 10**13\u000acm**-2 column density systems. No lines with b < 15 km/s are found.\u000a

We develop the Boltzmann\u000aequations for this process, paying particular attention to spin polarisation\u000aeffects. Such decays can, under certain circumstances, lead to a process of\u000arunaway stimulated decays or `neutrino-lasing' resulting, for suitable boson\u000amass, in the production of mixed-dark-matter. We discuss a number of variations\u000aon the model; we show how the yield of cold particles can be increased by a\u000asimple modification to our original proposal. We discuss the singlet-majoron\u000amodel as a possible framework for these decays.\u000a

V  A model is presented in which supernova-driven winds from early galaxies\u000areionize the intergalactic medium by z=5. This scenario can explain the\u000aobserved absence of a Gunn-Peterson trough in the spectra of high-redshift\u000aquasars providing that the bulk of these early galaxies are quite small, no\u000amore massive than about 10^8 solar masses. It also predicts that most of the\u000aIGM was enriched to at least 10% of current metal content by z=5 and perhaps as\u000aearly as z=15. The existence of such early mini-galaxies violates no spectral\u000aconstraints and is consistent with a pure CDM model with b<2. Since the final\u000aradius of a typical ionized bubble is only around 100 kpc, the induced\u000amodification of the galaxy autocorrelation function is negligible, as is the\u000ainduced angular smoothing of the CMBR. Some of the gas swept up by shells may\u000abe observable as pressure-supported Lyman-alpha forest clouds.\u000a

V  We use ensembles of high-resolution CDM simulations to investigate the shape\u000aand amplitude of the two point correlation function of rich clusters. The\u000astandard scale-invariant CDM model with $\u005cOmega=1$ provides a poor description\u000aof the clustering measured from the APM rich cluster redshift survey, which is\u000abetter fitted by models with more power at large scales. The amplitudes of the\u000arich cluster correlation functions measured from our models depend weakly on\u000acluster richness. Analytic calculations of the clustering of peaks in a\u000aGaussian density field overestimate the amplitude of the N-body cluster\u000acorrelation functions, but reproduce qualitatively the weak trend with cluster\u000arichness. Our results suggest that the high amplitude measured for the\u000acorrelation function of richness class $R \u005cgeq 2$ Abell clusters is either an\u000aartefact arising from incompleteness in the Abell catalogue, or an indication\u000athat the density perturbations in the early universe were very non-Gaussian.\u000a

V  One still cannot conclusively assert that the universe underwent a neutral\u000aphase, despite the new COBE FIRAS limit y<0.000025 on Compton y-distortions of\u000athe cosmic microwave background. Although scenarios where the very early\u000a(z=1000) ionization is thermal, caused by IGM temperatures exceeding 10000K,\u000aare clearly ruled out, there is a significant loophole for cosmologies with\u000atypical CDM parameters if the dominant ionization mechanism is photoionization.\u000aIf the ionizing radiation has a typical quasar spectrum, then the y-constraint\u000aimplies roughly h^{3/2}\u005cOmega_b Omega_0^{-1/4}<0.1 for fully ionized models.\u000aThis means that BDM models with Omega_0 around 0.15 and reionization at about\u000az=1000 are strongly constrained even in this very conservative case, and can\u000asurvive the y test only if most of the baryons form BDM around the reionization\u000aepoch.\u000a

V  We have selected an all--sky sample of 893 galaxies from the IRAS FSC--2,\u000adefined by a total (ADDSCAN) 12um flux limit of 0.22~Jy. Completeness is\u000averified to 0.30~Jy, below which we have quantified the incompleteness down to\u000a0.22~Jy for our statistical analysis. \u005cP The Seyfert subsample is the largest\u000aunbiased sample of (118) Seyfert galaxies ever assembled and is complete not\u000aonly to 0.30~Jy at 12um, but also with respect to a bolometric flux limit of\u000a$\u005csim2.0\u005ctimes10^{-10}$~(cgs). The average $V/V_{max}$ for the full sample,\u000acorrected for incompleteness at low fluxes, is $0.51\u005cpm0.04$, while that for\u000aSeyferts is $0.46\u005cpm0.10$, suggesting that several Seyferts are yet to be\u000aidentified in our sample. The AGN luminosity functions (LFs) are more complete\u000athan those of the optically selected CfA Seyfert galaxies for all luminosities\u000aand AGN types. \u005cP The 60um LF for a complete 60um--flux--limited (at 8.3~Jy)\u000asubsample of 235 galaxies is in satisfactory agreement with those derived from\u000athe bright galaxy sample (BGS) and the deep high--galactic latitude sample,\u000aboth selected at 60um. Over the high lum. range where our sample and the BGS\u000aoverlap, however, our space densities are systematically lower by a factor of\u000a$\u005csim 1.5$, whereas at low lum. our space densities are higher by about the\u000asame amount. Comparable results are obtained when comparing the far--IR LF of\u000aour entire sample with the one derived from the BGS. This is not unexpected,\u000abecause of the bias towards high-luminosity spirals caused by selection at\u000a60um.\u000a

V  In this paper we have examined the internal dynamics of the globular cluster\u000aNGC 362. A V band surface brightness profile (SBP) was constructed from CCD\u000aimages, and, after it was determined that the cluster is not post\u000acore-collapse, fit with single- and multi-mass King-Michie (KM) models. The\u000atotal cluster luminosity is 1.70 $\u005cpm 0.1 \u005ctimes 10^5$ L$_V$\u005csol. A total of\u000a285 stellar spectra were obtained of 215 stars for radial velocity\u000adeterminations. Four stars showed strong evidence for radial velocity\u000avariations and are probably members of binary systems. The true cluster binary\u000afraction was determined from simulations to be 0.15 for circular orbits or 0.27\u000afor orbits with a distribution function $f(e) = e$ ($e$ is eccentricity). This\u000arelatively high binary detection frequency may indicate that NGC 362 is\u000aoverabundant in binaries compared to other clusters. The 208 remaining stars\u000ashowed no sign of rotation. The best agreement with both the kinematic data and\u000athe SBP were for shallow mass functions $x = 0.0 - 0.5$ and intermediate\u000aamounts of anisotropy in the velocity dispersion tensor. The cluster mass is M\u000a= $2.5 - 3.5 \u005ctimes 10^5$ M\u005csol\u005c for a global mass-to-light ratio of M/L$_V$ =\u000a1.5 - 2.0 M\u005csol/L$_V$\u005csol. This low value for $x$ is in disagreement with the\u000acorrelation between $x$ and the height above the Galactic disk seen for a\u000asample of other clusters. The results are also different from the sharp turn-up\u000ain the low mass end of mass functions derived from some deep luminosity\u000afunctions of three other globular clusters.\u000a

V  If the dark halo matter is primarily composed of MACHOs toward the lower end\u000aof the possible detection range ($ < 10^{-3}$ $M_{\u005codot}$) a fraction of the\u000alens detection events should involve the lens crossing directly in front of the\u000adisk of the background star. Previously, Nemiroff (1987) has shown that each\u000acrossing would create an inflection point in the light curve of the MACHO\u000aevent. Such inflection points would allow a measure of the time it took for the\u000agravitational lens to cross the stellar disk. Given an independent estimate of\u000athe stellar radius by other methods, one could then obtain a more accurate\u000aestimate of the velocity of the lens. This velocity could then, in turn, be\u000aused to obtain a more accurate estimate of the mass range for the MACHO or disk\u000astar doing the lensing.\u000a

V  Early reionization changes the pattern of anisotropies expected in the cosmic\u000amicrowave background. To explore these changes, we derive from first principles\u000athe equations governing anisotropies, focusing on the interactions of photons\u000awith electrons. Vishniac (1987) claimed that second order terms can be large in\u000aa re-ionized Universe, so we derive equations correct to second order in the\u000aperturbations. There are many more second order terms than were considered by\u000aVishniac. To understand the basic physics involved, we present a simple\u000aanalytic approximation to the first order equation. Then turning to the sec-\u000aond order equation, we show that the Vishniac term is indeed the only important\u000aone. We also present numerical results for a variety of ionization histories\u000a[in a standard cold dark matter Universe] and show quantitatively how the sig-\u000anal in several experiments depends on the ionization history. The most\u000apronounced indication of a re-ionized Universe would be seen in very small\u000ascale experiments; the expected signal in the Owens Valley experiment is\u000asmaller by a factor of order ten if the last scattering surface is at a\u000aredshift $z\u005csimeq100$ as it would be if the Universe were re-ionized very\u000aearly. On slightly larger scales, the expected signal in a re-ionized Universe\u000a{\u005cit is} smaller than it would be with standard recombination, but only by a\u000afactor of two or so.\u000a

V  We investigate the possibility of kaon condensation in the dense interior of\u000aneutron stars through the s--wave interaction of kaons with nucleons. We\u000ainclude nucleon--nucleon interactions by using simple parametrizations of\u000arealistic forces, and include electrons and muons in $\u005cbeta$--equilibrium. The\u000aconditions under which kaon condensed cores undergo a transition to quark\u000amatter containing strange quarks are also established. The critical density for\u000akaon condensation lies in the range (2.3--5.0)$~\u005crho_0$, where\u000a$\u005crho_0=0.16$~fm$^{-3}$ is the equilibrium density of nuclear matter. For too\u000alarge a value of the strangeness content of the proton, matter with a kaon\u000acondensate is not sufficiently stiff to support the lower limit of $1.44\u000aM_\u005codot$ for a neutron star. Kaon condensation dramatically increases the\u000aproton abundance of matter and even allows positrons to exist inside the core.\u000aWe also consider the case when neutrinos are trapped in the matter. Neutrino\u000atrapping shifts both kaon condensation and the quark matter transition to\u000ahigher densities than in the case of cold, catalyzed matter. A newly--formed\u000aneutron star is expected to have a rather low central density, the density\u000arising only after mass accretion onto the star ends after a few seconds. Thus,\u000ait is likely that if kaon condensation and/or the quark--hadron phase\u000atransition occur, they do so only during or after the mass accretion and\u000aneutrino trapping stages. We suggest that neutrino observations from a galactic\u000asupernova may provide direct evidence for or against a condensate and/or a\u000aquark--hadron transition.\u000a

V  In this letter we propose a physical explanation for recently reported\u000acorrelations between pairs of close and antipodal gamma-ray bursts from\u000apublicly available BATSE catalogue. Our model is based on the cosmological\u000ascenario in which bursters are located at cosmological distances of order of\u000a0.5--2~Gpc. Observed distribution of gamma-ray bursts strongly suports this\u000aassumption. If so gamma-ray bursts may provide a very good probe for\u000ainvestigating the topological structure of the Universe. We notice that\u000acorrelation between antipodal events may in fact indicate that we live in the\u000aso called Ellis' small universe which has Friedman-Roberston-Walker metric\u000astructure and nontrivial topology.\u000a

V  Sub-arcsecond imagery (HRCAM, 0".35 - 0".57 FWHM) and two-dimensional\u000aspectrography (TIGER, 0".9 FWHM) of the central nucleus of M31 have been\u000aobtained at CFHT. The photometric data clearly show the double-peaked nucleus,\u000ain excellent agreement with a recent HST image by Lauer et al. 1993. We built\u000adeconvolved surface brightness models, using the multi-Gaussian expansion\u000amethod. We then perform a detailed morphological analysis of the three central\u000aphotometric components (bulge, nucleus and bright secondary peak) and derive\u000avarious spatial luminosity models (oblate and triaxial). Stellar velocity and\u000avelocity dispersion fields were derived from the TIGER data: the former\u000adisplays an extremely rapid rotation around the true center of the galaxy,\u000awhile the latter exhibits a peaked structure offset in the opposite direction\u000aof the brightest light peak. Neglecting these offsets,both extended versions of\u000athe virial theorem and detailed hydrodynamical models confirm the classical\u000astrong central mass concentration, perhaps a supermassive black hole of about\u000a7.10**7 Msun, as well as a large excess of circular motions. These offsets,\u000ahowever, suggest that the nucleus presently undergoes a strong stellar\u000aoscillation, with non-stationary, non-axisymmetric dynamics. This too reopens\u000athe case for a strong central mass concentration.\u000a

V  The Lagrangian perturbation theory on Friedman-Lemaitre cosmologies\u000ainvestigated and solved up to the second order in earlier papers (Buchert 1992,\u000aBuchert \u005c& Ehlers 1993) is evaluated up to the third order. On its basis a\u000amodel for non-linear clustering applicable to the modeling of large-scale\u000astructure in the Universe for generic initial conditions is formulated. A\u000atruncated model is proposed which represents the ``main body'' of the\u000aperturbation sequence in the early non-linear regime by neglecting all\u000agravitational sources which describe interaction of the perturbations. However,\u000aI also give the irrotational solutions generated by the interaction terms to\u000athe third order, which induce vorticity in Lagrangian space. The consequences\u000aand applicability of the solutions are put into perspective. In particular, the\u000amodel presented enables the study of previrialization effects in gravitational\u000aclustering and the onset of non-dissipative gravitational turbulence within the\u000acluster environment.\u000a

V  In this paper, I present the calculation of the third and fourth moments of\u000aboth the distribution function of the large--scale density and the large--scale\u000adivergence of the velocity field, $\u005ctheta$. These calculations are made by the\u000amean of perturbative calculations assuming Gaussian initial conditions and are\u000aexpected to be valid in the linear or quasi linear regime. The moments are\u000aderived for a top--hat window function and for any cosmological parameters\u000a$\u005cOmega$ and $\u005cLambda$. It turns out that the dependence with $\u005cLambda$ is\u000aalways very weak whereas the moments of the distribution function of the\u000adivergence are strongly dependent on $\u005cOmega$. A method to measure $\u005cOmega$\u000ausing the skewness of this field has already been presented by Bernardeau et\u000aal. (1993). I show here that the simultaneous measurement of the skewness and\u000athe kurtosis allows to test the validity of the gravitational instability\u000ascenario hypothesis. Indeed there is a combination of the first three moments\u000aof $\u005ctheta$ that is almost independent of the cosmological parameters $\u005cOmega$\u000aand $\u005cLambda$, $${(<\u005ctheta^4>-3<\u005ctheta^2>^2) <\u005ctheta^2> \u005cover\u000a<\u005ctheta^3>^2}\u005capprox 1.5,$$ (the value quoted is valid when the index of the\u000apower spectrum at the filtering scale is close to -1) so that any cosmic\u000avelocity field created by gravitational instabilities should verify such a\u000aproperty.\u000a

V  It is well known that Gamma-ray Burst spectra often display a break at\u000aenergies $\u005csimless 400$ keV, with some exceptions extending to several MeV.\u005c \u005c\u000aModeling of a cosmological source population is thus non-trivial when comparing\u000athe catalogs from instruments with different energy windows since this spectral\u000astructure is redshifted across the trigger channels at varying levels of\u000asensitivity. We here include this important effect in an attempt to reconcile\u000aall the available data sets and show that a model in which bursts have a\u000a``standard'' spectral break at $300$ keV and occur in a population uniformly\u000adistributed in a \u005cqo $=1/2$ universe with no evolution can account very well\u000afor the combined set of observations. We show that the source population cannot\u000abe truncated at a minimum redshift $z_{min}$ beyond $\u005csim 0.1$, and suggest\u000athat a simple follow-on instrument to BATSE, with the same trigger window, no\u000adirectionality and 18 times better sensitivity might be able to distinguish\u000abetween a \u005cqo$=0.1$ and a \u005cqo$=0.5$ universe in $3$ years of full sky coverage,\u000aprovided the source population has no luminosity evolution.\u000a

V  The most promising source of gravitational waves for the planned detectors\u000aLIGO and VIRGO are merging compact binaries, i.e., neutron star/neutron star\u000a(NS/NS), neutron star/black hole (NS/BH), and black hole/black-hole (BH/BH)\u000abinaries. We investigate how accurately the distance to the source and the\u000amasses and spins of the two bodies will be measured from the gravitational wave\u000asignals by the three detector LIGO/VIRGO network using ``advanced detectors''\u000a(those present a few years after initial operation). The combination ${\u005ccal M}\u000a\u005cequiv (M_1 M_2)^{3/5}(M_1 +M_2)^{-1/5}$ of the masses of the two bodies is\u000ameasurable with an accuracy $\u005capprox 0.1\u005c%-1\u005c%$. The reduced mass is measurable\u000ato $\u005csim 10\u005c%-15\u005c%$ for NS/NS and NS/BH binaries, and $\u005csim 50\u005c%$ for BH/BH\u000abinaries (assuming $10M_\u005codot$ BH's). Measurements of the masses and spins are\u000astrongly correlated; there is a combination of $\u005cmu$ and the spin angular\u000amomenta that is measured to within $\u005csim 1\u005c%$. We also estimate that distance\u000ameasurement accuracies will be $\u005cle 15\u005c%$ for $\u005csim 8\u005c%$ of the detected\u000asignals, and $\u005cle 30\u005c%$ for $\u005csim 60\u005c%$ of the signals, for the LIGO/VIRGO\u000a3-detector network.\u000a

V  Recently the Polish-American collaboration OGLE has reported the observation\u000aof four possible microlensing events by monitoring, over several months, the\u000abrightness of millions of stars in the region of the galactic bulge. If these\u000aevents are due to microlensing, the most accurate way to get information on the\u000amass of the dark compact objects, that acted as gravitational lenses, is to use\u000athe method of the mass moments. Here I apply this method to the analysis of the\u000aevents detected by OGLE. The average mass turns out to be 0.28$M_{\u005codot}$,\u000asuggesting that the lens objects are faint disk stars. The same method applied\u000ato the five microlensing events detected so far by the EROS and MACHO\u000acollaborations, which monitor stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud, leads to an\u000aaverage value of 0.08$M_{\u005codot}$ for the dark compact halo objects.\u000a

V  We have worked out evolutionary synthesis models of the broad-band spectral\u000aenergy distribution of elliptical galaxies over the whole frequency range from\u000aUV to far--IR. Internal extinction and far--IR re--emission by interstellar\u000adust have been taken into account in a self--consistent way. Diffuse dust\u000aemission has been modelled in terms of two components: warm dust, located in\u000aregions of high radiation intensity, and cold dust, heated by the general\u000aradiation field. Emission from circumstellar dust clouds at different galactic\u000aages was also taken into account. The models reproduce well the present average\u000abroad--band spectrum of nearby ellipticals over about four decades in\u000afrequency. Under the assumption of a dust--to--gas ratio proportional to the\u000ametallicity, the fraction of bolometric luminosity coming out at far-IR\u000awavelengths strongly evolves during the galaxy lifetime, ranging from very low\u000alocal values ($\u005clsim 0.5\u005c%$) to $\u005csim 30\u005c%$ or more in the first billion years.\u000aSome models even imply that early phases are optically thick; these models\u000aprovide an excellent fit of the observed spectral energy distribution of the\u000ahigh redshift galaxy IRAS F10214$+$4724. Far--IR observations may thus play a\u000akey role in investigating the early evolution of elliptical galaxies. A strong\u000afar-IR evolution of early-type galaxies might be a crucial ingredient to\u000aexplain the deep $60\u005cmic$ IRAS counts.\u000a

V  We present results of numerical simulation of inviscid thick accretion disks\u000aand wind flows around black holes. We use Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)\u000atechnique for this purpose. Formation of thick disks are found to be preceded\u000aby shock waves travelling away from the centrifugal barrier. For a large range\u000aof the parameter space, the travelling shock settles at a distance close to the\u000alocation obtained by a one-and-a-half dimensional model of inviscid accretion\u000adisks. Occasionally, it is observed that accretion processes are aided by the\u000aformation of oblique shock waves, particularly in the initial transient phase.\u000aThe post-shock region (where infall velocity suddenly becomes very small)\u000aresembles that of the usual model of thick accretion disk discussed in the\u000aliterature, though they have considerable turbulence. The flow subsequently\u000abecomes supersonic before falling into the black hole. In a large number of\u000acases which we simulate, we find the formation of strong winds which are hot\u000aand subsonic when originated from the disk surface very close to the black hole\u000abut become supersonic within a few tens of the Schwarzschild radius of the\u000ablackhole. In the case of accretion of high angular momentum flow, very little\u000aamount of matter is accreted directly onto the black hole. Most of the matter\u000ais, however, first squeezed to a small volume close to the black hole, and\u000asubsequently expands and is expelled as a strong wind. It is quite possible\u000athat this expulsion of matter and the formation of cosmic radio jets is aided\u000aby the shock heating in the inner parts of the accretion disks.\u000a

V  Physics beyond the simplest version of the standard electroweak model is\u000arequired to reconcile the results of the chlorine and the Kamiokande solar\u000aneutrino experiments. None of the 1000 solar models in a full Monte Carlo\u000asimulation is consistent with the results of the chlorine or the Kamiokande\u000aexperiments. Even if the solar models are forced articficially to have a ${}^8\u000aB$ neutrino flux in agreement with the Kamiokande experiment, none of the\u000afudged models agrees with the chlorine observations. This comparison shows that\u000aconsistency of the chlorine and Kamiokande experiments requires some physical\u000aprocess that changes the shape of the ${}^8 B$ neutrino energy spectrum. The\u000aGALLEX and SAGE experiments, which currently have large statistical\u000auncertainties, differ from the predictions of the standard solar model by $2\u000a\u005csigma$ and $3 \u005csigma$, respectively. The possibility that the neutrino\u000aexperiments are incorrect is briefly discussed.\u000a

V  A self-consistent, adiabatic model for the {\u005cit long-time} behaviour of tidal\u000acapture binaries is presented. It is shown that most capture orbits behave\u000achaotically, with the eccentricity following a quasi-random walk between the\u000avalues of $\u005cappless 1$ and some lower limit associated with the periastron\u000aseparation at capture.\u000a  If dissipation is taken into account, the binary goes through a short and\u000aviolent chaotic phase, followed by a long quiescent phase in which it slowly\u000acircularizes from a high eccentricity on a much longer timescale than\u000apreviously thought. A consequence is that merger is less likely than previously\u000athought, and hence such binaries will be available as a heat source to the\u000acores of globular clusters, particularly while they are in the less tightly\u000abound, highly eccentric phase.\u000a  If the model is correct, any highly eccentric binaries observed in globular\u000aclusters which contain a main-sequence star will most likely be found to have a\u000aperiod derivative much smaller than that predicted by the standard model.\u000a  We also predict that the companion of PSR B1718-19 in NGC 6342 which is a\u000aglobular cluster binary likely to have been formed by tidal capture (Wijers \u005c&\u000aPaczy\u005c'{n}ski 1993) will be found to have a mass of around $0.2M_\u005codot$.\u000a  The model may be used to describe the evolution of low-mass X-ray binaries,\u000apulsar binaries, and cataclysmic binaries which abound in globular clusters.\u000a

The interpolation into the\u000azoa is based on the assumed gravitational nature of the velocity field implying\u000aa potential flow. The main dynamical features at a distance r=4000 km/s are (a)\u000athe peak of the Great Attractor connecting Centaurus and Pavo at l=330, (b) a\u000amoderate bridge connecting Perseus-Pisces and Cepheus at l= 140, and (c) an\u000aextension of a large void from the southern Galactic hemisphere into the zoa\u000anear the direction of Puppis, l=220-270. We find a strong correlation between\u000athe mass density and the IRAS and optical galaxy density at $b=+-20, which\u000aindicates that the main dynamical features in the zoa should also be seen in\u000agalaxy surveys through the Galactic plane.

V  The formation of quasar black holes during the hydrodynamic collapse of\u000aprotogalactic gas clouds is discussed. The dissipational collapse and long-\u000aterm dynamical evolution of these systems is analysed using three-dimensional\u000anumerical simulations. The calculations focus on the final collapse stages of\u000athe inner baryonic component and therefore ignore the presence of dark matter.\u000aTwo types of initial conditions are considered: uniformly rotating spherical\u000aclouds, and irrotational ellipsoidal clouds. In both cases the clouds are\u000ainitially cold, homogeneous, and not far from rotational support ($T/|W|\u000a\u005capprox 0.1$). Although the details of the dynamical evolution depend\u000asensitively on the initial conditions, the qualitative features of the final\u000aconfigurations do not. Most of the gas is found to fragment into small dense\u000aclumps, that eventually make up a spheroidal component resembling a galactic\u000abulge. About 5\u005c% of the initial mass remains in the form of a smooth disk of\u000agas supported by rotation in the gravitational potential well of the outer\u000aspheroid. If a central seed black hole of mass $\u005cgsim10^6M_\u005codot$ forms, it can\u000agrow by steady accretion from the disk and reach a typical quasar black hole\u000amass $\u005csim10^8M_\u005codot$ in less than $5\u005ctimes 10^8\u005c,$yr. In the absence of a\u000asufficiently massive seed, dynamical instabilities in a strongly self-\u000agravitating inner region of the disk will inhibit steady accretion of gas and\u000amay prevent the immediate formation of a quasar.\u000a

V  The expected microlensing events of the LMC by the MACHOs of the LMC itself\u000aare calculated and compared with analogue events by objects in the Galactic\u000ahalo. The LMC matter distribution is modelled by a spherical halo and an\u000aexponential disk while a face-on exponential disk is used for the stellar\u000adistribution of the LMC. Among the microlensing events discovered by the MACHOs\u000aand EROS projects, a fraction of $22\u005c%$ could be caused by the lenses near the\u000acenter of the LMC or $13\u005c%$ from lenses at $5^o$ from the LMC center.\u000aTherefore, any statistical study of these microlensing events must take the LMC\u000alenses into account.\u000a

V  We consider a weighted biasing scheme for galaxy clustering. This differs\u000afrom previous treatments in the fact that the biased density field coincides\u000awith the background mass--density whenever the latter exceeds a given threshold\u000avalue. There is some physical motivation for this scheme and it is in better\u000aaccord with intuitive ideas than models based on the Kaiser (1984) analysis of\u000athe clustering of rich clusters. We explain how different classes of object\u000acould be biased in different ways with respect to the underlying density\u000adistribution but still have $b=1$. We also show that if one applies our scheme\u000aconsistently a weak dependence of $b$ upon density can be implied. This could\u000aalso be the reason why the correlation function of galaxies in groups does not\u000adiffer substantially from the correlation function of all galaxies.\u000a

V  Large-amplitude isothermal fluctuations in the dark matter energy density,\u000aparameterized by $\u005cPhi\u005cequiv\u005cdelta\u005crhodm/\u005crhodm$, are studied within the\u000aframework of a spherical collapse model. For $\u005cPhi \u005cga 1$, a fluctuation\u000acollapses in the radiation-dominated epoch and produces a dense dark-matter\u000aobject. The final density of the virialized object is found to be $\u005crho_F\u000a\u005capprox 140\u005c, \u005cPhi^3 (\u005cPhi+1) \u005crhoeq$, where $\u005crhoeq$ is the matter density at\u000aequal matter and radiation energy density. This expression is valid for the\u000aentire range of possible values of $\u005cPhi$, both for $\u005cPhi \u005cgg 1$ and $\u005cPhi \u005cll\u000a1$. Some astrophysical consequences of high-density dark-matter clumps are\u000adiscussed.\u000a

V  We have searched for gravitational-lens induced echoes between gamma-ray\u000abursts (GRBs) in NASA's orbiting {\u005cit Compton} Gamma Ray Observatory's Burst\u000aand Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) data. The search was conducted in two\u000aphases. In the first phase we compared all GRBs in a brightness complete sample\u000aof the first 260 GRBs with recorded angular positions having at least 5 \u005c%\u000achance of being coincident from their combined positional error. In the second\u000aphase, we compared all GRB light curves of the first 611 GRBs with recorded\u000aangular positions having at least 55 \u005c% chance of being coincident from their\u000acombined positional error. No unambiguous gravitational lens candidate pairs\u000awere found in either phase, although a ``library of close calls" was\u000aaccumulated for future reference. This result neither excludes nor\u000asignificantly constrains a cosmological origin for GRBs.\u000a

V  3C275.1 and \u005cNGC4651 make a particularly interesting quasar/galaxy pairing\u000abecause of the alignment of such a strong radio emitter behind the outer H\u005cI\u000adisk of a relatively undisturbed spiral galaxy. This provides an opportunity to\u000astudy the spin-temperature characteristics of atomic hydrogen at low column\u000adensities, in an apparently star-free environment. We previously reported a\u000atentative detection of absorption against the quasar based on VLA C--array\u000aobservations; we have now made more sensitive maps of the H\u005cI emission from\u000a\u005cNGC4651 with the VLA D--array, and we have attempted to confirm the weak H\u005cI\u000aabsorption against the quasar at higher spatial and spectral resolution in VLA\u000aB--array. The possible absorption feature against this quasar appears to be\u000aweaker than we previously suspected, even though it seems fairly clear that H\u005cI\u000aemission is present close to the line of sight to the quasar.The weakness of\u000athe possible absorption seems also to confirm, conversely, the trend found in\u000aprevious observations that where strong absorption lines are seen, the galaxies\u000ashow evidence of disturbance. The possible detection of (or limits on)\u000aabsorption suggest that the neutral gas in the outer disk is quite warm. We use\u000athe absorption and emission measurements to set lower limits on the combination\u000aof heating inputs outside the star-forming regions of a disk galaxy and/or the\u000aintensity of the cosmic background radiation around 100 eV.\u000a

V  In this paper, we investigate the effects of galactic extinction close to the\u000asouth galactic pole and plate--to--plate matching errors. These represent the\u000amost probable systematic errors within the Edinburgh/Durham Southern Galaxy\u000aCatalogue (EDSGC) which could affect the angular correlation function. The\u000adistribution of extinction within the EDSGC area was obtained using the Stark\u000a{\u005cit et al.} HI map and the IRAS $100\u005cmu\u005crm{m}$ flux map. We find that the\u000aamplitude of the whole EDSGC correlation function varies by less than ${\u005crm\u000a\u005cdelta w}=0.003$ for reddening ratios $\u005crm{R_V}$ in the range\u000a$3.25\u005crightarrow6$. This corresponds to a range in average extinction of ${\u005crm\u000aA_B}=0.12\u005crightarrow0.24$. Simulations were carried out to assess the\u000acontribution to the correlation function from correlated and uncorrelated plate\u000amagnitude errors. The only simulation that affected the large--scale power seen\u000ain \u005cw was for correlated plate errors with a systematic plate--to--plate offset\u000aof ${\u005crm \u005cDelta m} =0.02$. This represented an overall $0.4$ magnitude\u000adifference between the ends of the EDSGC which was inconsistent with checks\u000acarried out with external photometry. All other simulations had an\u000ainsignificant effect on the large--scale form of the correlation function.\u000aThese tests suggest that the large--scale power seen in the EDSGC correlation\u000afunction is due to intrinsic clustering and is not an artifact of the\u000aconstruction or location of the catalogue.\u000a

V  One of the crucial aspects of density perturbations that are produced by the\u000astandard inflation scenario is that they are Gaussian where seeds produced by\u000atopological defects tend to be non-Gaussian. The three point correlation\u000afunction of the temperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background\u000aradiation (CBR) provides a sensitive test of this aspect of the primordial\u000adensity field. In this paper, this function is calculated in the general\u000acontext of various allowed non-Gaussian models. It is shown that by COBE and\u000athe forthcoming South Pole and Balloon CBR anisotropy data may be able to test\u000aprovide a crucial test of Gaussianity.\u000a

V  The study by White (1984) on the growth of angular momentum in dark haloes is\u000aextended towards a more detailed investigation of the spin parameter\u000a$\u005clambda\u005cequiv L\u005csqrt{E}/{G M^{2.5}}$. Starting from the Zel'dovich\u000aapproximation to structure formation, a dark halo is approximated by a\u000ahomogeneous ellipsoid with the inertial tensor of the (highly irregular)\u000aLagrangian region $\u005cUpsilon$ from which the dark halo forms. Within this\u000aapproximation, an expression for the spin parameter can be derived, which\u000adepends on the geometry of $\u005cUpsilon$, the cosmological density parameter\u000a$\u005cOmega_0$, the overdensity of the dark halo, and the tidal torque exerted on\u000ait. For Gaussian random fields, this expression can be evaluated statistically.\u000aAs a result, we derive a probability distribution of the spin parameter which\u000agives $\u005clambda\u005csimeq0.07^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$, consistent with numerical\u000ainvestigations. This probability distribution steeply rises with increasing\u000aspin parameter, reaching its maximum at $\u005clambda\u005csimeq0.025$. The 10 (50,90)\u000apercentile values are $\u005clambda=0.02$ (0.05,0.11, respectively). There is a weak\u000aanticorrelation of the spin parameter with the peak height $\u005cnu$ of the density\u000afluctuation field $\u005clambda\u005cpropto \u005cnu^{-0.29}$. The dependence on $\u005cOmega_0$\u000aand the variance $\u005csigma$ of the density-contrast field is very weak; there is\u000aonly a marginal tendency for the spin parameter to be slightly larger for\u000alate-forming objects in an open universe. Due to the weak dependence on\u000a$\u005csigma$, our results should be quite generally applicable and independent on\u000a

V  We trace the evolution of cosmic microwave background photons propagating\u000athrough a reionized model universe. The reionization of the intergalactic\u000amedium is achieved by UV photons emitted from the decaying `hot' dark matter\u000aneutrinos. The model universe is represented by a comoving cube through which\u000awe propagate photons and subject them to the Sachs-Wolfe effect and Thomson\u000ascattering off the ionized fraction of the IGM, beginning at z=1900 until the\u000apresent z=0. The simulation follows the evolving matter inhomogeneities and\u000amicrowave background photons into the present nonlinear regime and yields\u000atemperature maps of the microwave sky as a comoving observer would detect. Our\u000atemperature maps display anisotropies on scales ranging from 2 to 8 degrees\u000awith rms amplitudes ranging from DT/T_{rms} =2.8 to 3.4 times 10^{-5} without\u000areionization. If we allow the neutrinos to decay and subsequently reionize the\u000aIGM, the level of the temperature anisotropies is reduced to DT/T=0.8 to 1.1\u000atimes 10^{-5}. This includes the Doppler shifts suffered by the CMB photons as\u000athey scatter off the moving ionized fraction of the IGM. If, however,\u000areionization is caused by a late and sudden energy input into the IGM, we find\u000athat some reduction in $\u005cDelta T/T$ occurs, but not enough to make this\u000ascenario consistent with observations. We find that the decaying neutrino\u000ahypothesis is more efficient at reducing primordial anisotropies and generates\u000asmaller Doppler anisotropies than a model reionized via a late and sudden\u000aenergy input into the IGM.\u000a

However the fluctuations are consistent with the level\u000aexpected to result from a superposition of instrument noise and sky signal\u000aarising from a Gaussian power law model of initial fluctuations, with a\u000aquadrupole normalized amplitude of 17 $\u005cmu$K and a power law spectral index $n\u000a= 1$. We place limits on the amplitude of intrinsic three-point correlations\u000awith a variety of predicted functional forms.\u000a

V  We show how, based on considerations on the observed form of the galaxy\u000a2-point spatial correlation function xi(r), a very simplified -- yet\u000asurprisingly effective -- model for the linear density fluctuations power\u000aspectrum can be constructed. We first relate the observed large-scale shape of\u000axi(r) to a power-law form for the power spectrum, P(k)\u005cpropto k^{-2.2}. For a\u000aplausible value of the bias parameter b = 1/sigma_8 ~ 1.8, one has (delta_rho /\u000arho)_{rms} ~ 1 r ~ 3.5/h Mpc, suggesting that the change of slope observed in\u000axi(r) around this scale marks the transition between the linear and nonlinear\u000agravitational regimes. Under this working hypothesis, we use a simple\u000aanalytical form to fit the large-scale correlations constraints together with\u000athe COBE CMB anisotropy measurement, thus constructing a simple\u000aphenomenological model for the linear power spectrum. Despite its simplicity,\u000athe model fits remarkably well directly estimated power spectra from different\u000aoptical galaxy samples, and when evolved through an N-body simulation it\u000aprovides a good match to the observed galaxy correlations. One of the most\u000ainteresting features of the model is the small-scale one-dimensional velocity\u000adispersion produced: sigma_{1d} = 450 Km s^{-1} at 0.5/h Mpc and sigma_{1d} =\u000a350 Km s^{-1} for separations larger than ~ 2/h Mpc.\u000a

V  We have modified the standard code for primordial nucleosynthesis to include\u000athe effect of the slight heating of neutrinos by $e^\u005cpm$ annihilations. There\u000ais a small, systematic change in the $^4$He yield, $\u005cDelta Y \u005csimeq +1.5\u005ctimes\u000a10^{-4}$, which is insensitive to the value of the baryon-to-photon ratio\u000a$\u005ceta$ for $10^{-10}\u005cla \u005ceta \u005cla 10^{-9}$. We also find that the\u000abaryon-to-photon ratio decreases by about 0.5\u005c% less than the canonical factor\u000aof 4/11 because some of the entropy in $e^\u005cpm$ pairs is transferred to\u000aneutrinos. These results are in accord with recent analytical estimates.\u000a

V  We present a new technique for estimating the distance to young open\u000aclusters. The method requires accurate measurement of the axial rotation period\u000aof late-type members of the cluster: rotation periods are first combined with\u000aprojected rotation velocities and an estimate of the angular diameter for each\u000astar -- obtained using the Barnes-Evans relation between colour and surface\u000abrightness. A 'best' cluster distance estimate is then determined using\u000astandard techniques from the theory of order statistics which are in common use\u000ain the general statistics literature. It is hoped that this new method will\u000aprove a useful adjoint to more traditional distance methods, and will provide a\u000abetter %determination of the distance scale within the solar neighbourhood.\u000a(Figures / preprint available on request)\u000a

V  Two quasi-linear approximations, the frozen flow approximation (FFA) and the\u000afrozen potential approximation (FPA), have been proposed recently for studying\u000athe evolution of a collisionless self-gravitating fluid. In the FFA it is\u000aassumed that the velocity field remains unchanged from its value obtained from\u000athe linear theory whereas in FPA the same approximation is made for the\u000agravitational potential. In this paper we compare these and the older\u000aZel'dovich approximation by calculating the evolution of the density in\u000aperturbation theory. In particular we compute the skewness, including the\u000asmoothing effects, and the kurtosis for the FFA, FPA and Zel'dovich\u000aapproximation and compare their relative accuracy.\u000a

V  Dynamical friction due to field stars and tidal disruption caused by a\u000acentral nucleus are crucial in determining the evolution of the globular\u000acluster system in an elliptical galaxy. In this paper I examine the possibility\u000athat some of galactic nuclei have been formed by frictionally decayied globular\u000aclusters moving in a triaxial potential. The initial rapid growth of the\u000anucleus, due mainly to massive clusters on box orbits falling in a short time\u000ascale into the galactic centre, is found to be later slowed by tidal disruption\u000ainduced by the nucleus itself on less massive clusters in the way described by\u000aOstriker, Binney & Saha.\u000a  The efficiency of dynamical friction is such to carry to the centre of the\u000agalaxy enough globular cluster mass available to form a compact nucleus, but\u000athe actual modes of its collisionless formation remains to be investigated.\u000a  The mass of the resulting nucleus is determined by the mutual feedback of the\u000atwo mentioned processes, together with the knowlegde of the initial spatial,\u000avelocity and mass distributions of the globular cluster family. Moreover, we\u000adiscuss the possibility that the globular cluster fall to the galactic centre\u000ahas been cause of primordial violent galactic activity.\u000a  An application of the model to M31 is presented.\u000a

V  The gravitational field of monopoles, cosmic strings and domain walls is\u000astudied in the quadratic gravitational theory $R+\u005calpha R^2$ with $\u005calpha\u000a|R|\u005cll 1$, and is compared with the result in Einstein's theory. The metric\u000aaquires modifications which correspond to a short range `Newtonian' potential\u000afor gauge cosmic strings, gauge monopoles and domain walls and to a long range\u000aone for global monopoles and global cosmic strings. In this theory the\u000acorrections turn out to be attractive for all the defects. We explain, however,\u000athat the sign of these corrections in general depends on the particular higher\u000aorder derivative theory and topological defect under consideration. The\u000apossible relevance of our results to the study of the evolution of topological\u000adefects in the early universe is pointed out.\u000a

V  The determined abundances of primordial $^4He$ and $^7Li$ provide a basis\u000awith which to test the standard model of big bang nucleosynthesis in\u000aconjunction with the other two light element isotopes $D$ and $^3He$, also\u000aproduced in the big bang. Overall, consistency in the standard big bang\u000anucleosynthesis model is best achieved for a baryon-to-photon ratio of\u000atypically $3 \u005ctimes 10^{-10}$ for which the primordial value of $D$ is five\u000atimes greater than the present observed abundance and about three times greater\u000athan the pre-solar value. We consider various models for the chemical evolution\u000aof the Galaxy to test the feasibility for the destruction of D without the\u000aoverproduction of $^3He$ and overall metallicity. Models which are capable of\u000aachieving this goal include ones with a star formation rate proportional to the\u000agas mass fraction or an exponentially decreasing star formation rate. We\u000adiscuss the effect of parameters that govern the initial mass function and of\u000asurviving fractions of $^3He$ in stars between one and three solar masses.\u000a

V  By means of a general classification of the different kinds of matter of\u000anature form a chain from the world of the subatomic particles to the large\u000abodies of the universe, the galaxies. Then, it proposes a new baryonic force\u000afor the universe that is the fifth force which has been proposed in the\u000aliterature. It explains the universal expansion itself and shows why the\u000aexpansion must be slowing down at present. This force depends on the ratio of\u000athe number of neutrons to the number of protons. Its potential for the Universe\u000ais a well. At the bottom of the well the potential is of the form $kx^2$, where\u000a$x$ is the separation among the bodies under consideration. It is suggested\u000athat Nature has six fundamental forces which are unified in pairs and,\u000atherefore, reduced to three at $t=0$. The condition for having a closed\u000auniverse is found. This new force, called superweak force in this paper,\u000aexplains also the evolution of galaxies and shows how the arms of spiral\u000agalaxies(including barred spirals) are formed. The variation of the Hubble\u000aconstant with time is shown. It is shown that quarks are formed of prequarks\u000awhich may be the true elementary particles. The paper also gives a physical\u000aexplanation for quark confinement. The energies of baryon states are calculated\u000ain a simple manner. The paper proposes the existence of four more bosons, one\u000afor the superweak interaction and three for the superstrong interaction. The\u000asix figures will be sent by mail upon request.\u000a

V  Compton scattering of external radiation by nonthermal particles in\u000aoutflowing blazar jets is dominated by accretion-disk photons rather than\u000ascattered radiation to distances $\u005csim 0.01-0.1$ pc from the central engine for\u000astandard parameters, thus clarifying the limits of validity of the model by the\u000apresent authors and the model of Sikora, Begelman, \u005c& Rees. On the basis of\u000acontemporaneous Ginga X-ray and EGRET gamma-ray observations, we estimate the\u000aradius of 3C 279's gamma-ray photosphere to be smaller than estimated by\u000aBlandford. There is thus no need to require that the acceleration and emission\u000asites of gamma-ray blazars to be located farther than $\u005csim 10^{2-3}$\u000agravitational radii from the central engine. We argue that lineless BL Lac\u000aobjects, rather than quasars, are more likely to be detected in the TeV energy\u000arange.\u000a

We show that to a great\u000aextent, the CMB anisotropies depend only on the geometry of the Universe, which\u000ain a matter dominated universe is determined by $\u005cOmega$, and the optical depth\u000ato the surface of last scattering. In particular, the location of the primary\u000aDoppler peak depends primarily on $\u005cOmega$ and is fairly insensitive to the\u000aother unknown parameters, such as $\u005cOmega_b$, $h$, $\u005cLambda$, and the shape of\u000athe power spectrum. Therefore, measurements of CMB anisotropies on small scales\u000amay be used to determine $\u005cOmega$.\u000a
